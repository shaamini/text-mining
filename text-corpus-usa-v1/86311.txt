received 2 doses pfizer only felt 2/10 pain, both times, following day. didn’t feel anything until i raised my arm &amp; felt heaviness. not minimize other people’s experience but “power suggestion” is real. people say you’ll feel shitty after, then you will. person_shrugginglight_skin_tone‍female_sign️
