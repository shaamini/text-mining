Went to a grocery store and saw someone with anti-vaccination saying that it was because their family had implanted it and said that he had symptoms like this because of some kind of vaccine that the doctor had given him when he was a child. So they won't vaccinate anything anymore. and said that it was unfair to prove that he had been vaccinated, blah blah blah
