my niece has covid, my 83 yo mom has been exposed. everyone is vaccinated &amp; boosted. i am annoyed that they had rapid tests hand &amp; didnâ€™t use them before my mom arrived. also that they scoffed at my recommendation that they open windows. mom still stayed overnight face_with_symbols_on_mouth
