For a professor of modern history at the Autonomous University of Barcelona to say this is unheard of. Judging something from the 16th century with the eyes of the 21st is wrong. It is as if we analyzed Rome in Hispania, with the eyes of the 21st, what did the Numantines think, the Vaceos, Vetones, etc.
