Well, I already vaccinated my 8-year-old little princess with the first dose of Pfizer for minors, which I had to do, I just crossed the border of CD Juarez, El Paso, TX and without any problem, without further requirements other than identification and a waiting time of 5 minutes we get vaccinated.
