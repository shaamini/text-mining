What if there is no one to talk to? I haven't been to a hospital since I was diagnosed with gbs 14 years ago, and now I'm in Canada, I don't have any symptoms, and I can't reach a specialist. Mommy is pretty anti-vax and sends a lot of conspiracy links every day and it's going to be crazy. What should I do now disappointed_face
