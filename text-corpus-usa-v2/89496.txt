Today I have received my second pfizer vaccination. I choose to inject at cvs as usual, but this time it's the Boston branch. The first round was injected at New York's CVS pharmacy. with many branches Almost every corner of the city in the US is similar to a boots store, but has a zone for various vaccination services. &gt;&gt; This thread will review the second injection.
