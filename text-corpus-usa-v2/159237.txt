What is the business of a friend's mother who sells 2nd grade clothes? It was talking to a girl who does business on social networks and I taught her to sell in a modern way. At the start of the pandemic, their sales dropped by 90%, they are already 3 months old and they have recovered many customers. good luck your dad
