I got vaccinated in Veracruz, with no problems because my ine was out of here again, Le√≥n... the sad thing is that there are many people who don't want to be vaccinated. - because they implant a chip - because it is not the pfizer - because it gives a strong reaction ... etc. they should have started in the big cities
