My parents have finished the two injections of pfizer and Pfizer for more than 48 hours, and there are no adverse reactions after the two injections, except that the area of ​​the needle is a little sore. My husband's sister/brother-in-law in New Zealand was also vaccinated with the same vaccine, and they both had the same reaction as my parents, except for soreness in the eye of the needle, there was no other reaction.
