flushed_face 4 doses of pfizer only in mexico they put me modern in the eu 7 months ago. I don't qualify for a booster and I don't live in tx where people don't get vaccinated and anyone like my sister-in-law offers it, I haven't thought about getting vaccinated in Mexico, I'd rather a teenager get it.
