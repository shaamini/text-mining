I remember that the pfizer vaccine only lacked subjects under the age of 16 among the volunteers in the clinical trial, and the elderly were not lacking, so the FDA expert group voted on whether to approve the market, and one of the experts said that there were no experimental results under the age of 16. The reason was that they voted against, but at that time, the vaccine was considered safe for the elderly, so all countries gave priority to the elderly.
