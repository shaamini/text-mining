we were lucky to get sick without consequences for the fetus last November. my wife and I fell ill together, she was 20 weeks old. but it was very scary. in the summer comirnaty / pfizer-biontech were vaccinated by the whole family and were happy that our son will also get antibodies with milk. thumbs_uplight_skin_tone
