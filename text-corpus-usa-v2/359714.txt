I agree, you want to take the vaccine, I'm happy for you .. it's hard to drag or force those who don't want to take it. why do you want to be jealous of people who refuse to be vaccinated, right? So I feel safe, right? Why do you want to be afraid of people who haven't been vaccinated, eh thinking_face
