If moderna enters Thailand, how much will it cost to give it to the house for injection? I know that parents can pay for themselves. But this will work out anyway. I work 7 days and get two doses of vaccination for my parents. Let her save the money for shopping. Because the cost of the vaccine is that it shouldn't be wasted in the first place, it should be free.
