To say the least, I live in the USA where they charge us $50 for appointment processing, $100 for a single dose of pfizer-biontech, $80 for a single dose of moderna, and $150 for johnson. If you want a triple cocktail, a single dose is $125. If I could go to my country, I would love to be vaccinated without paying a penny.
