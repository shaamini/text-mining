the vaccine is not to avoid getting sick, it is to reduce the possibility of death or serious illness, that is called % effectiveness. Like any drug, some have a reaction. I have pfizer, I continue to use face_with_medical_mask and social distance, the day after the vaccine I ran 11 km without a problem.
