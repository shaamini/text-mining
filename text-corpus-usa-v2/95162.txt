I just had my second pfizer injection for 3 days. The side effects were not so severe, the first needle, arm pain, dizziness, nausea, about 2-3 days disappeared. The second needle didn't hurt as much as the first needle, but my arm pain and nausea, now I don't have any symptoms. grinning_face_with_sweatgrinning_face_with_sweat
