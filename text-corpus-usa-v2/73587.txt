I was in the sinopharm study, and they vaccinated me in May, that vaccine is not part of the national vaccination plan because it was an upch and unmsm program. and here I got vaccinated with pfizer 3 weeks ago because that's what my aunt asked me to enter her house, I think I didn't do wrong, or yes thinking_facethinking_face
