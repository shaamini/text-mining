Two are my favorite reviewers. Love this discussion, debate. A small flaw to mention: Weidong: Moderna was not mentioned when discussing the temperature requirements for US vaccines. Xia Ming: China's retirement system partially solved the employment problem at that time. This is the first time I hear Li Weidong's point of view on China's demographic dividend, and I think it makes sense.
