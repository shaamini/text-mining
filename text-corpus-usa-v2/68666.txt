It seems that there are many people who have a strong second side reaction. I was vaccinated with pfizer's covid-19 vaccine, but the second time I had a severe headache and back pain as a side reaction. If the side reaction is severe, please see a doctor or other medical institution immediately. Many people have less adverse reactions in 2 days, but please pay close attention to changes in your physical condition and do your best to overcome them. flexed_biceps
