I practically got two different vaccines against covid. 1st: astrazeneca fatal reaction 2nd: janssen without reaction I'm still alive, I did this because in Ecuador they didn't give me the second dose and after consulting a doctor I got vaccinated here in United_States. nothing happened to me. finish
