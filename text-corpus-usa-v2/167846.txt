"modern" in my neighborhood has a flat roof, beautiful, "california style". no one stays in it for more than 2 years they buy and sell after the 1st winter there is no closed garage, you arrive from the supermarket and just take it out and buy the salad it has wilted and the eggs have frozen. it's time for the architects
