I also got into the subject a lot with my two pregnancies. I had zero risk. The delivery was so complicated and so bad that if they didn't perform a cesarean section in 12 minutes, my son would die. Everything came divine with music and breathing but it was not enough. It wasn't luck, it was modern science.
