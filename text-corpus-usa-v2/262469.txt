i’ve remained silent about unvaccinated nurses home healthcare until now. i received my ivig last week. normally within few days someone would come. however, it’s 2-week wait because i request fully vaccinated nurses. scheduler acted as if delay is my fault. idkperson_shruggingmedium_skin_tone‍female_sign️
