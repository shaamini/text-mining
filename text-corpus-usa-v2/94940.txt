ready my second dose of pfizer syringe #covid19. I'll let you know if I get a third eye or a sixth finger on one hand. spied on is the least of it, we have been spied on for a long time. I will continue the same way, from home to work and vice versa. there is no reason yet to go inventing and going crazy.
