A batch (330,000 doses) of moderna's new crown vaccine was suspended by California due to excessive side effects. Thinking of the use of pfizer vaccines in Europe (there are no deaths in the UK, 10 deaths in Germany, 23 deaths in Norway, and 100 people in the Netherlands with obvious side effects), I may be thinking blindly, but I am afraid that the quality of the vaccines produced by desperately rushing to work is worrying.
