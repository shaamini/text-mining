Canada has discontinued astrazeneca under the age of 55. Those aged 55-59 will receive astrazeneca, and those over 60 will receive a pfizer or moderna vaccine. I think they will lower the age limit, they will be pfizer or moderna under 55 years old. There is a different practice for those living in risky areas, they try to vaccinate everyone.
