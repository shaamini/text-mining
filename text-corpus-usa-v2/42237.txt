Which season does Charly not play anything in? I already asked for Janssen but he is injured. I don't care about Celso or Krane. Max is not there. Nico is a substitute for Montes and Pab√≥n does not gravitate. I am left with the line of 4 starters and Ponchito in this 2021. There is a lot of hypocritical jingoism here.
