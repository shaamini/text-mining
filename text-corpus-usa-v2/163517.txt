My name was put on the first list of vaccinations in the first batches by virtue of my work, and I can not hide from you that I felt some fear at the time because the vaccination was new, so I preferred to wait. But today, after the effectiveness of the vaccines has proven, there is no longer an argument, and today I took the first doses of the moderna vaccine, and I encourage everyone to register and take the vaccine.
