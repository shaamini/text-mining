In the biopharmaceutical industry, China is two generations behind in R&D level with Europe, America and Japan, and even one generation behind India (see the Yaoshen movie). The ultimate solution to this outbreak is a safe and efficient vaccine. The Chinese government must face this reality and implement international purchases as soon as possible (from pfizer, it will cost about 24 billion US dollars, which is equivalent to the money given to Argentina this time), otherwise it can only lock down the city year after year.
