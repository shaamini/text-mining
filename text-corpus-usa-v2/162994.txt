we just got text that we are scheduled our second dose moderna either tuesday or wednesday. ayyyy person_facepalminglight_skin_tone‍female_sign️ i was hoping it’d be next week. weary_face if it’s tuesday, i guess that should be okay assuming i don’t get bad side effects more than day. wednesday is no good.
