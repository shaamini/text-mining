My sister-in-law who is a doctor in Los Angeles caught covid "she was cured" in quotes, she was very weak and they vaccinated her with Pfizer for a week and I threw her in bed again... she was almost the same as when she had the virus, poor thing, she is 46 we did face time and he hated getting vaccinated.
