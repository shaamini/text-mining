Review of vaccination at Mega. In fact, you can walk-in during this period. Just use your passport + fill out a few documents. But on the day I asked, I still didn't feel rested enough, so I made an appointment for the injection date. If you make an appointment for injections on the web, you will know that each cvs branch near us has what vaccines. The branch here has only sprayed Pfizer if you want moderna,j&amp;j. Then press to select another branch?
