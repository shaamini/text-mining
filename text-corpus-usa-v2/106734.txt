We just had pfizer injections last Tuesday. We have no symptoms. In addition to tightness at the injection site My symptoms are less than when injected with flu shot. My parents injected the first dose of moderna with a mild pain for 1-2 days, but the second dose was heavier than the one with a slight fever. Tired and in pain for more than 2-3 days. An acquaintance injected j&amp;j, as far as I know, no symptoms at all.
