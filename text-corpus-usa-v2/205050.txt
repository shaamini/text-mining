Opposition parties tried to put pressure on the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare by making a tweet suggesting the medicinal effect even though Shionogi's clinical trial was not over, and tried to approve it early before proving proper medicinal effect. We should thoroughly criticize Prime Minister Kishida. It is nothing more than a bond between Shionogi and a politician who ignores science.
