I turned, I thought Astrazeneca not mrna "the pfizer-biontech moderna vaccines use mrna technology while astrazeneca single-dose j&amp;j shots are considered viral vector-based vaccines." Also, there are researches that say that you take mRNA after AstraZeneca, this is better and increases the efficacy.
