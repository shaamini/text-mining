cold again with a second dose of pfizer vaccine but at least without fever like many people told me they took it around here but I also took two doses of 1000mg of advil as a precaution at an interval of 8 hours. I hope it continues without fever but there's no way to complain. folded_handsmedium-light_skin_tone
