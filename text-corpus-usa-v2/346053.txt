The discontinuation of the ENSURE coffee flavor on twitter has become a hot topic. It's complicated for me to sell ENSURE in the past. I should have known that it would not be profitable, but I feel that the measures are slow. At that time, I heard from my boss that "manufacturing ENSURE is expensive, so generics will never come out", but now is the time to need generics?
