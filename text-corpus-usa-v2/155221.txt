Review of moderna injections. It's been two injections. The first injection: the first day, the upper arm is a bit tight. The second day was painful. It's gone on the third day. Second needle: Compared to the first dose, I felt a little less pain on the first day. But the second day was much more painful. There was a groaning like a fever. No third day Left a little pain in my arm.
