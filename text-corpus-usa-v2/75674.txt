Review of 2 injections of Pfizer injections smiling_face_with_sunglasses First dose - Pain in arm directly at injection site for 2 to 3 days, pain when someone touches it or raises the arm. Annoying pain, second needle - pain in the right arm that was injected for about 1 day, body swarming like a fever, went to bed 1, woke up and disappeared .. End of review winking_face #pfizer
