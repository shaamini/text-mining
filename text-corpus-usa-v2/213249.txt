I had the 2nd dose at the end of April. We are going to my brother and mother in Texas, let's not take any germs, he said that there is no antibody left, 6 months max time, so we got booster shots, I slept on the bed for 2 days.. nothing happened to him, but.. I never got covid, but God knows how I would be. ..
