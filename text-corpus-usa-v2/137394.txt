I keep seeing complaints from the teachers that I hit them badly their first dose of #moderna was wonderful for me, I got my first dose and the booster, the only thing that hurt was my arm and I was a little sleepy, before I came to Mexico I wanted my third dose but 6 months had not passed. slightly_frowning_face #vaccine
