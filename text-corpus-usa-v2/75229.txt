In order to get the second shot, I cancelled three times and rescheduled four times. Yesterday, I went for the test and was told that there was only pfizer. Then I was asked to go to another house for a walk, but they didnâ€™t go home after the second shot. I quickly took a shower for four hours. The pain is so painful that I can't lift it up. Dad said it felt better to put ice cubes on it. In fact, it still hurts a lot. I don't know if I can go downstairs tomorrow. I'll be fine. Today's work, boss, please eat well. Haha, the manager is swollen again.
