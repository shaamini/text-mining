22 hours after receiving the reinforcement from #moderna I feel like I've lost my arm from the intense pain that doesn't stop, I couldn't sleep because I couldn't get comfortable, I took a paracetamol at 4am and slept 6 hours fortunately I don't have a fever or a headache does anyone know how much more is missing
