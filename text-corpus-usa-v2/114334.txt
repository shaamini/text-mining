you are being dishonest. On the one hand, you think as if you were going to get the vaccine in Mexico and you reject the Zeneca back, perhaps that gives your comment drama and on the other you say that you are already vaccinated. It's very easy, the US doesn't lend Pfizer because it hasn't vaccinated all of us gringos.
