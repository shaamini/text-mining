numbers as an example, is a roll of population size. imagine you have 100 people 90 have already been vaccinated 10 are not in the hospital there are 7 people 4 vaccinated 3 unvaccinated the antivax will say "vaccines are useless there are 4 vaccinated" but they are 4 out of 90 vs 3 out of 10 unvaccinated
