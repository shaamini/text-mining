What about the vaccines? My husband and I have the Pfizer, my parents the modern one and some friends the J&amp;J and they are all fine there. It's different because of the irregularities in Colombia I was panicking and I didn't let my parents wear anything there, but a syringe is a syringe and it can save us.
