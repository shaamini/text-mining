We went to the Bronx for my son to get vaccinated. It is very far away and the uber cost us more than 60 dlls per trip but it was where there was. Everything was very organized by the military, there were no queues and it took less than 30 minutes with everything and the 15 rest. they put the pfizer on it and it already came in a syringe, party_popperclapping_hands
