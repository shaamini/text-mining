is our case. end of the month we go x 2nd dose of pfizer. We were already going to get it because of our age, but not my 17-year-old son, so we took advantage of the trip and vaccinated the 3 of us where we know that from a vial they will only get 5 doses and not 7. I don't plan to trust #drdeath with my health.
