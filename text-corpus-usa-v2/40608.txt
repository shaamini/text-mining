The worrying thing about Rayados is the 11 games that Funes has had without scoring a goal, in that same period Janssen scored 5 goals, but in this tournament neither of the 2 has had any luck in front of the goal, one of them was even booed and he came out with only 4 games no goal person_shrugging‍male_sign️.
