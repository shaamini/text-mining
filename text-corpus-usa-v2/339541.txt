I feel that this can't be helped. The city is not always as populous as Japan, and there are various urban gardens in the United States. dfw is a good example. There may be few Japanese in the city of dallas, but there are many Japanese in the United States (many) in the suburbs plano, richardson, carrollton, etc. around them.
