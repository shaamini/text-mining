Honestly, when I first had the pfizer vaccine, moderna didn't want to inject it. People who know, no one wants to inject. Everyone's scared But in the end, the injection was not because the company forced it. But I think that in the end the world will be something that is forced to inject If you don't spray, you can't fly. Other countries will not allow entry. which is true
