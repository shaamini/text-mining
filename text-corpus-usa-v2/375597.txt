I can't dance like that, but I remember learning country dance at a summer camp, dancing at a local junior high school dance party, and dancing at a high school prom. In the United States, there are many activities that you can acquire sociability from when you were a child. You don't have to be good at dancing. It's enough if you move with the glue on the spot!
