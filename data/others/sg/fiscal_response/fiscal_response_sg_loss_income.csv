3,"@scottwww Not an $AMZN holder, but i think it may be the strong performance in AWS (which takes up the bulk of Amazonâ€™s valuation).

AWS grew revenue 40% and op income 50% yoy, generating an op income of 5.3B in the quarter.

Without AWS amazon would be making loss this quarter (ex RIVN)."

6,"@ofmeowandbake @tanhuiyi @furryphotos For SIRS (self employed), TRF (loss of income or reduced income) and Covid Support Grant, must apply on your own with income documents.

10,"Govt: Hey thereâ€™s a game we can all play, itâ€™s simple, just stay at home.
