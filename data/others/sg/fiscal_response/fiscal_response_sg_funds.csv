3,"Watched @sandra_tlibe on Paul Barron and I'm now more bullish than ever! Excited for the partnerships reveal but let's not rush them. We just gotta have patience and trust the team.

The question now is how should I allocate my funds between $gZIL and $ZIL? ü§î

The team will be monitoring the flow of funds and market sentiments to continuously adjust the APY or token inflation rate to ensure that they are in line with the prevailing monetary policy and keep token holders safe from excessive token inflation."
5,"26/
Once we have obtained a sizeable amount of treasury to deploy as liquidity for the different stablecoins and is expecting a slower flow of new funds we will adjust the APY down to maintain the price on a slower upward trajectory."
6,"23/
On the other hand, for projects that have already raised huge treasuries, it cannot continue to expect a 100x growth in funds during the same time period.

Hint: This is why OHM APY is 3-digits now. https://t.co/M4csdYJmA4"

If a project attracts a high level of funds during its initial stage of launch and the inflation rate is kept low, the token price can hike excessively and crowd out new investors. https://t.co/WEyUqFvirD"
8,"19/
Finally, if the fund stops receiving new funds (through bonding), the ‚ÄúAPY‚Äù or inflation (through staking) will only be redistributing the value of the project and bringing the price down. https://t.co/CJKMOIujyl"
9,"18/
If the inflation rate exceeds the rate where new funds flow in, the price of the token falls. https://t.co/a6t5Ui5Fqw"
10,"17/
If funds flow in at a rate higher than the rate where new tokens are introduced, the price of the token increases. This is where the demand for the token (from people willing to swap assets like DAI for the governance token) exceeds the supply (from staking rewards). https://t.co/VlEMzSHpnn"
11,"16/
Using dark green blocks to represent new funds, we can see that if the rate of new funds equates to the inflation of the token supply, the price of the token remains the same. https://t.co/RgYauRTqtW"
12,"15/
Think of the token supply as the base of a container, the ‚ÄúAPY‚Äù as the rate the container is growing, and the flow of funds as a tap filling the container with more liquid. The height of the liquid determines the market price for the token."
13,"14/
However, the model is not static because there is a flow of funds (from the sale of bonds) and there is continuous inflation of the token supply as existing tokens are staked for more tokens. https://t.co/dpHi254i1U"
