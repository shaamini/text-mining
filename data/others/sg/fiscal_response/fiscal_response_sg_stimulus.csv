1,@WeiWangPKU China is right not to turn those anger and indignation into a wasted force but to use them as stimulus to achieve better and higher goals to forge further ahead. Let them be mired in negativity while China strength becomes even stronger together with other friendlier nations.
2,"@tanner207031482 @merriman_md @tedcruz Yes, the infrastructure bill and stimulus checks contributed to inflation, but even if Trump got re-elected CPI numbers would still be sky-high. We have been seeing record economic growth by the way. Look at a FRED chart or two once in awhile"
3,"The speed of the shift in Fed and market expectations is remarkable, given that nothing that surprising has happened in the last month. The Fed should have cut back stimulus when it became clear that fiscal policy was (thankfully) doing enough. Now we are staring at a see-saw"
