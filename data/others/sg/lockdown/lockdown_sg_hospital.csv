You can argue as much as you like about not believing official figures, though my guess is if they were showing us in a favourable light you'd swear by them. If they included those that died outside of hospital. Now that would make you gasp!"

2207,@CobblerEd27 How many cases divided by how many deaths. Basically in the UK out of every 8 people admitted to hospital with coronavirus 1 dies.
2208,Lecturer mitec tu musim pkp ni guna dia punya personal 3D printer utk buat face shield bg kt hospital kt johor. Manfaatkan la waktu free tu. Kalau hg guna waktu lapang dgn cara salah mmg la hg mentol illnose

2212,@vndlynArt @kayewhitehead @lamour Thank you. For many rural communities like where I grew up awareness was very slow to arrive. I’m hoping the hospitals can manage or else tens of thousands of families will suffer similar losses :(

2214,The pain is overwhelming. How to go home? Guess i’ll be stuck in the hospital till this pain goes away at least.
2215,@scousepete4 Yes but if deaths were counted outside of hospital like from care homes the figures would be a lot worse. You can only play with the cards you are given.

2221,@Bob0Mar Don’t nurses change to uniforms when they reach the hospital anyway? Simply because when travelling in uniform you potentially can get foreign contaminants on your uniform and for healthcare that’s a big no no
2222,"Dekat area kawasan tu dah jadi macam kedai jahit baju pula weh. 

Yes, pekerja-pekerja hospital tu diminta untuk menjahit PPE sendiri sebab kekurangan PPE.

Jadi memang betul mereka sangat kekurangan keperluan asas sebagai frontliner : PPE. 

Hospital hanya ada satu mesin jahit."
2223,"Tadi ada pi satu hospital kerajaan nak sampaikan face shield dan face mask. Then tanya diorang,  apa lagi kekurangan, mana tahu NGO boleh bantu ka kan. 

Diorang cakap mesin jahit. Tanya eh pasaipa mesin jahit, diorang bawa pi satu kawasan ni. Ada tiga bilik."
