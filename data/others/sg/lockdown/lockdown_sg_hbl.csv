224,"So no. NO, teachers are not relaxing at home. NO, parents are not doing the job FOR teachers. Because parents are not doing what you've read in the above thread. Teachers prep lessons, family to assist the learning. Without either, there is no HBL."
225,"Again, that is just 2 lessons for total of 2 learning hours in a week. It takes so much man hours to prep for. Try to picture the workload that goes in the rest of the learning hours for HBL."
226,"Everyday, I underestimate the demands of prepping that goes into HBL. For just 2 lessons worth, took me and a colleague a whole week to prep."
