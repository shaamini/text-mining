0,Would be fascinating to know what % are actually impacted by a vaccine mandate vs inconvenienced by it not having a vaccine pass.
1,@Farq_Doff I bet the thing they're really worried about is that you're more infectious and have more serious implications than Omicron. And once we pass on this dangerous disease of questioning the narrative Jacinda and Co will realise there's no vaccine available...
2,@ArendtRead Yeah. Around 2000 people the first day in Wellington (probably another thousand or so in the South Island because they didn't realise you can't get on the ferry without ID and a Vaccine pass or negative Covid test). Numbers now dwindled to a couple of hundred people?
3,"Wha wha wha, Jacinda said you don‚Äôt have to scan, just sight. MF this is my roof, my policy for entry. Considering I‚Äôve already had ppl try to pass off fake vaccines and i ran the largest risk of infection, not you as a customer. I‚Äôm gunna scan it"
4,"MFs worried that scanning the vaccine pass shows me their name and birthdate. If twinks have to show me their government issued ID to verify their age, I can scan ur vaccine pass."
5,"@MatthewHootonNZ In fairness, Seymour suggested on television this morning that the time for mandates may be over and that ACT always advocated a recent test or a vaccine pass to begin with."
6,"@BR3NDA Getting good uptake from the ""My Little Vaccine Pass"" background, in Comic Sans yet."
7,"@publicaddress I mean, given antivaxxers thought there couldn't possibly be only three complaints to council about still having to pay rates despite vaccine pass mandates, this sounds like the level of individual we're dealing with."
8,Vaccine clinic at Kelburn campus going hard. The staff there are so lovely too! And every pharmacy I‚Äôve passed in town that does walk in vaccinations is chocka. Makes me so happy üòçüòçüòç

10,@joshwaihi @WhiteHatNZ So it does prevent deaths and does prevent infections.  However with NZ present high rates due to co-operative society members the need for vaccine mandate has passed.  But you can still expect a long time of passes and capacity limits to slow infection rates

12,"@MariaBickley1 @TheAlmightyGod8 @NewshubNZ Parachutes, condoms, seatbelts aren't 100% guarantees. Neither are vaccines.  Not the measles or mumps vaccine that you probably took, nor this one.  But they still do a bloody good job.

The vaccinated can catch it, and can pass it on.  But are LESS LIKELY than the unvaccinated."
13,@joshoconnorchen It's not straightforward when those business can still trade. The problem is not the vaccine pass.
14,@EerjkMcRaeOF I‚Äôd prefer @MarjaLubeck stopped telling porkies. National has not demanded that the vaccine pass be stopped yet.
15,@FoxyLustyGrover What are they eating? If the cafes are closed &amp; require a vaccine pass anyway? Maybe be they‚Äôll move when they starve?
16,@MarjaLubeck Rubbish. The vaccinated people with the pass are the ones spreading the virus. All of the places of interest require vaccine passes!! Stop lying to the public.
17,@MarjaLubeck Except the Vaccine Pass does NOTHING to keep people safe because the vaccinated still spread the virus. As proven by the Vacinated only events
18,Should the current vaccine mandate and vaccine pass system evolve into the booster mandate and booster mandate? #nzpol #convoynz2022
19,@camrynpetebrown So you are saying they are not calling for the end of the vaccine pass? That would be reassuring.
20,@NototyrannyNOW friend‚Äôs dad passed away 24 hrs ago due to covid. I know many people who‚Äôve been terribly ill due to covid. I know a number of people who recovered quickly from covid.

* Don't pass the disease onto others
I continue this today. https://t.co/uSrYN9AxqX"
402,YOUR MENTAL HEALTH IS A REASON TO BE ABLE TO GET THE VACCINE IN THIS COUNTRY PASS IT ON
403,"@laurie_ms @beyondbeeton They won‚Äôt ask you when you go to get the vaccine. As long as you pass the eligibility checker and book your time slot from there, you‚Äôre golden"
404,"I‚Äôve just tested positive for HPV66 from my last partner. I‚Äôve got a year to clear it, and then I‚Äôll get the vaccine with my girls lol - they will get it at 10. Life. A friend‚Äôs mom RIP got it from dating in her 50s and passed away from cervical cancer a few years after.

#HPV"
405,"@boypage Other vaccines will probably be approved in AUS before Pfizer is available to 50+. I wonder if they ask for proof of age at the mass vac sites, you could pass as under 50."
406,"@shane25873 Tried again today. No luck in my area. Passed a walk in GP with sign  by the door ""Vaccines here - limited supply"" May tried when less tired."
407,"he‚Äôs gone back to the old playbook of saying he will have more meetings with the states and territories so that he can pass the buck, so that he can pass blame off to the states &amp; territories for the failure that has occurred with the rollout of vaccines.

408,"Coronavirus Australia: COVID vaccines for aged care behind schedule with half of residents still waiting https://t.co/ta61zPWAB1 - Why are N/H residents been passed from being vaccinated?? They were to be among the first, before people in the community but it is not happening!!"
409,"@mariekehardy 100% agree about the fucked up roll-out...however do believe that no vaccine is 100% effective at preventing getting it, and vaccinated can still pass it on. 80% efficacy Pfizer 1 shot, 90% 2 shots. AZ 76% 2 shots. So risk remains (just lower). All health/aged care shd get pfizer"
410,"@ProMistressesUK Goodness me. 

I‚Äôm glad the vaccines are working in the UK. I‚Äôm counting down the days when we can be somewhat normal again. 

One of my Aunty‚Äôs passed away from cancer last year and we had to watch her funeral online."
411,"@jordanender @mcfunny @JustWantHealth @SusieFrmSeattle @Alec_Zeck Offs. Yeadon worked no where near vaccines. He has been thoroughly exposed as, passed his use by date, so often by so many in their field of expertise yet you are still referencing him. Ugh.ü§Æ"
412,"@jussyc123 @stew_pot82 Reducing viral load (amt u have in u) &amp; shedding (ability to shed virus = passing it on) is one effect if these vaccines as you cannot pass on as much if u expel less (if u r infected). Plus, if u can't catch it because your immune system repels it, you can't pass it on at all."
413,"#Duterte government passed multiple bills releasing billions for the pandemic, while borrowing more billions as loans. Where are these funds going if #COVID19PH cases are still increasing, economy still worsening, while country depends on donated vaccines? https://t.co/VRhRn4WWme"
414,@goodfoodgal Same vaccine that your local doctor can‚Äôt give ? Think I will pass !
415,@mitchdurie1 @richieplz @spartytalkback This is certainly fast - but absolutely not ‚Äòrushed‚Äô. Never before have medical efforts been so uniformly mobilised. This has passed every single step that any other vaccine has passed.
416,@StevePriceMedia @constan10101 Do the people don‚Äôt want the vaccine are ok? They Dan kill my wife she has no amune system if one of this people give  Covid to her will Kill her is not only them is people like us they are selfish and what we should go if one of them pass Covid ???
417,"Looking forward to seeing the published data/details. Just 0.04% of Israelis caught #COVID -19 after two shots of Pfizer vaccine. 371 out of 715,425 Israelis who passed at least a week after receiving 2 doses Pfizer¬†#coronavirus¬†vaccine contracted virus. https://t.co/ZlxzucFHIk"
418,"Seems the vaccine wars are heating up as the days pass. People's expectations were, I think, unrealistic re timing (see next tweet). As this article highlights, manufacturing vaccines is not the same as manufacturing orange juice. #covid19

419,@NZBirder @PunkKia The vaccine won't stop any of that. You can still pass the virus on if you have had the vaccine
420,"@JoshButler Wait. I have an idea. Let‚Äôs pass legislation to allow emergency use of vaccines. Like the rest of the world. 

Too radical?"
421,"""Pfizer and BioNTech say their vaccine is '95% effective' and has passed safety checks"" No pharmaceutical companies - again - do not define national borders. https://t.co/GdrvH3rQDH"
422,"""Pfizer and BioNTech say their vaccine is '95% effective' and has passed safety checks""  Yeah - it is like hail damage  Israel's neighbourhood is not affected by it. https://t.co/GdrvH3rQDH"
423,"@iammarkcarnegie I‚Äôm so pro vaccine it hurts but would you take this Russian Hot Shot? 

I would probs pass."
