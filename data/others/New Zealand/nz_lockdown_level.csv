0,@AndreAlessi So when you have CAPS LOCK DOWN you have been pepper sprayed?
1,"@caffeine_addict To be clear: the downturn isn’t because of the vaccine mandates, it’s because Level Red has created a faux lockdown and so there are less people in the city. It’s misleading to use my Tweet to claim that it’s due to the mandates."
2,@SamuelHillNZ My Dad died during Level 4 lockdown after being unable to see his specialist. Ended up in Auckland Hospital for five weeks with only one family member allowed to visit. I had to pretend to be my sister so I could sneak in to see him the day before he died. Fucking cruel.
3,@viewspotnz I hope someone has made him retract his false claims about current red level in NZ its not a lockdown in fact I went out again to a restaurant for a meal today just have to sign in with vaccine pass that took 30mins to get online suggest you shouldn't comment on what you don't kn

10,"@joedamage92 @cjsbishop NB research in NZ showed no increase in suicides during the lockdown. If we hadn't had lockdowns we would have had thousands of deaths, so lockdowns pass the utility test. Plus they gave us 18 months at Level 1."
