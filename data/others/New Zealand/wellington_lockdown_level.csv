Just left the house, the day before NZ goes into level 4 lockdown and @Spotify plays 'Perfect day' - Lou Reed."
978,Ok so we supposed to be on level 3 lockdown but why are the roads still lowkey busy NZ?! We can't all be in essential businesses. I can confirm that some bakeries and mcds are still open 🙌🏾 https://t.co/8o85KPiTC9
979,"@DianaKAdams1 @RyanKellyMusic Hey sweetie. Sister is doing great, just tryingnto get her to rest is a job in itself. Cant keep a good lady down. Down here in NZ, we are up to 102 cases... so countries going to level 4, which is complete lockdown. Were ok, live rurally, and fully stocked."
980,Something like this should be in place with the Level 4 lockdown restrictions. https://t.co/GLaiPVVEU4
981,"Hi @motnz, can you please advise on what happens about WOFs that expire during lockdown? Can we have a grace period until things are back down to e.g. Level 3?"
982,"Well that’s NZ on level 3 with 48 h until we’re in full lockdown level 4. University labs closed. It’s a bit scary, stay safe everyone! 😰 #NZ #COVID19nz #Level3 #scary #StayAtHome"
983,Aaaaand New Zealand has reached level 4..... lockdown time 🥴🙏🏽
984,Primeira ministra aqui da NZ acaba de decretar level 3 de alerta ao #COVIDー19 e em 48h vamos para o level 4. Resumindo: Lockdown em todo o país em 48h!
985,As NZ goes into lockdown and moves to the highest level of Covid 19! Here’s something to brighten your day. Marcel turns 1! Happy birthday handsome man 🥰💕🎁🎈🥳 https://t.co/v2oSknB4ib
986,New Zealand just went to alert level 3 and going to full lock down in 48 hours and I just saw a guy shake hands with someone. Sigh #Covid_19nz

989,wow NZ just went to level 3 and will be at level 4 complete lockdown in 48hours. we only have 100 cases. that is leadership.

991,"1.Declare level 3 today
2.Lock down 
3.Set up drive through testing
4.Close schools
#keepNZSafe"
992,"@richardhills777 Most health officials are saying shutting down everything now means a shorter shut down than if we just wait. So the sooner we hit level 4, the shorter the lock down period ect..."
993,Dayle Brown about to unveil some radical plans to keep harness racing going on some level in Victoria. Involves @Tabcorp_Park as a lockdown zone. More to come.
994,"Why is Scott Morrison contradicting himself, saying that Victoria has been put into lockdown from Tuesday however shopping centres may remain open. Why give the people an opportunity to leave THEIR HOUSES and risk the level of infection spreading. LOCKDOWN=STAY INSIDE PEOPLE"
995,@jacindaardern I’m your biggest fan. I think you are doing an amazing job. But unfortunately There are some many NZs that will not take this seriously until you call level 4 lockdown everything.
996,"Alert level 2 palang here sa NZ. level 3 wala na me job level 4 lockdown na.

Bumili na me ng rice, snacks, vitamins, canned goods, cleaning products etc good for 2 months samin ng asawa ko. 🙁 https://t.co/x3OZ1S71MZ"
997,"Why is everyone so surprised that the air pollution level has improved during lockdown? Is it really so astonishing that if we stop making pollution, then there won't be any pollution...🤔 #pollutionsolution"
998,What is the threshold or level required to institute “lockdown”. From the government it’s constantly “not yet.” What is yet? Rather than just saying “not yet” it would be so great for this to be explained. Thanks from the interested public.
999,2020 just reached a new level of shit. Overnight Mum's nursing home went into lockdown. No visitors allowed. Needs to be done but brings with it another level of stress 😥
1000,@piersmorgan Pretty much whole towns in Italy have it - thus requiring such a strict lockdown... on the grand scheme for the UK - it’s not that level at all! We need to focusing on prevtning spread not scaremongering officials to try and put the UK into lockdown?!
1001,@piersmorgan Exactly! And that’s why it’s on lockdown! Stop trying to panic everybody by comparing the UK which has a different level of healthcare available and a much smaller number of cases 🙄
1002,@daxa_tw We did the Majestic in Oct and Saphire last year and nearly booked Jan asian cruise rjis year as well. Id hate to be in an inside cabin right now on lockdown. Level 8 Minisuites looking good.
