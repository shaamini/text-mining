0,Would be fascinating to know what % are actually impacted by a vaccine mandate vs inconvenienced by it not having a vaccine pass.
1,@Farq_Doff I bet the thing they're really worried about is that you're more infectious and have more serious implications than Omicron. And once we pass on this dangerous disease of questioning the narrative Jacinda and Co will realise there's no vaccine available...
2,@ArendtRead Yeah. Around 2000 people the first day in Wellington (probably another thousand or so in the South Island because they didn't realise you can't get on the ferry without ID and a Vaccine pass or negative Covid test). Numbers now dwindled to a couple of hundred people?
3,"@SciBuff82 Its a tragic story. Beyond terrible...had a friend today whose 8yo daughter wanted the vax to play sport etc. 13 minutes after the jab, went grey, passed out. All the medical crew refused to recognise it was vaccine related. 
..
She seems ok now thankfully. 

The future though?"
4,"@samanthamaiden @JoshFrydenberg i have only seen one good protest in my life and that because a little girl was raped and passed away, every other protest is sh!t, i support the lockdown and vaccine mandates"
5,"@Ambulate666 The Wuhan virus was referred to as the boomer remover, but it seems that should be the name for these vaccines."
6,"Wha wha wha, Jacinda said you don‚Äôt have to scan, just sight. MF this is my roof, my policy for entry. Considering I‚Äôve already had ppl try to pass off fake vaccines and i ran the largest risk of infection, not you as a customer. I‚Äôm gunna scan it"
7,"MFs worried that scanning the vaccine pass shows me their name and birthdate. If twinks have to show me their government issued ID to verify their age, I can scan ur vaccine pass."
8,"@MatthewHootonNZ In fairness, Seymour suggested on television this morning that the time for mandates may be over and that ACT always advocated a recent test or a vaccine pass to begin with."
9,"@BR3NDA Getting good uptake from the ""My Little Vaccine Pass"" background, in Comic Sans yet."
10,"@publicaddress I mean, given antivaxxers thought there couldn't possibly be only three complaints to council about still having to pay rates despite vaccine pass mandates, this sounds like the level of individual we're dealing with."
11,@seancondev They are admitting the vaccines don't work.
12,Vaccine clinic at Kelburn campus going hard. The staff there are so lovely too! And every pharmacy I‚Äôve passed in town that does walk in vaccinations is chocka. Makes me so happy üòçüòçüòç
13,"@Max6_6_6_ @Simmotravels @Taniabanks24 @NSWHealth @pfizer Experimental is a term used to denote what occurs in petri dishes in a lab, in animals or proof of concept prior to population rollout. 
Covid vaccines have long passed that now, and are in post market clinical trials to determine rare side effects and longer term effectiveness"
14,"@AAragurn @BeentjesCarl @continu_um @thelastmalakai @YorkiePaul66 @HomesteadNZ All other vaccines have successfully passed clinical trials

No covid Vax has..

&amp; Vax manufacturing is fighting to HIDE some extremely negative Vax trial data"
15,"@KyleE84434133 @Drosera91 @The_Indemnifier @TheSciBabe So if there was legislation that was passed that says everyone has to get a vaccine, you'd be ok with it then?"
16,@joshwaihi @WhiteHatNZ So it does prevent deaths and does prevent infections.  However with NZ present high rates due to co-operative society members the need for vaccine mandate has passed.  But you can still expect a long time of passes and capacity limits to slow infection rates
17,"I love when people got at me for getting the covid vaccine saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs experimental‚Äù as a science student, that‚Äôs literally my life‚Ä¶ lol Im literally contemplating giving my body for research once I pass"
18,"‚ÄòZero IQ‚ÄôEvents from the Anti-Vax convoy travelling NZ:
- Convoy got derailed when someone made a pit stop at their house for tea 
- Convoy wasn‚Äôt able to board the Inter-Island ferry as nobody had their vaccine pass #Dumbkirk"
19,"Dan Andrews, my incompetence and nepotism led to unnecessary deaths at the start of the pandemic.
I'll cover this, I'll implement the longest lockdowns in the world, harsh vaccine mandates and shut down parliament and pass undemocratic laws to give me more power.
Labor."
20,"@MariaBickley1 @TheAlmightyGod8 @NewshubNZ Parachutes, condoms, seatbelts aren't 100% guarantees. Neither are vaccines.  Not the measles or mumps vaccine that you probably took, nor this one.  But they still do a bloody good job.

The vaccinated can catch it, and can pass it on.  But are LESS LIKELY than the unvaccinated."
21,@joshoconnorchen It's not straightforward when those business can still trade. The problem is not the vaccine pass.
22,"@BFMTV Personne pour dire √† ce con que son putin de pass sert √† rien

24,@EerjkMcRaeOF I‚Äôd prefer @MarjaLubeck stopped telling porkies. National has not demanded that the vaccine pass be stopped yet.
25,@FoxyLustyGrover What are they eating? If the cafes are closed &amp; require a vaccine pass anyway? Maybe be they‚Äôll move when they starve?
26,@MarjaLubeck Rubbish. The vaccinated people with the pass are the ones spreading the virus. All of the places of interest require vaccine passes!! Stop lying to the public.
27,@MarjaLubeck Except the Vaccine Pass does NOTHING to keep people safe because the vaccinated still spread the virus. As proven by the Vacinated only events
28,Should the current vaccine mandate and vaccine pass system evolve into the booster mandate and booster mandate? #nzpol #convoynz2022
29,@camrynpetebrown So you are saying they are not calling for the end of the vaccine pass? That would be reassuring.
30,@NototyrannyNOW friend‚Äôs dad passed away 24 hrs ago due to covid. I know many people who‚Äôve been terribly ill due to covid. I know a number of people who recovered quickly from covid. I know nobody who‚Äôs died or become ill from the vaccine. My conclusion - glad I used my personal choice to vax

32,@SamSachdevaNZ They should also be running the fun tweets at the bottom of the screen. Like the guys who got all the way to Picton before finding out they would need a vaccine pass. And that the ferry was expensive
33,@MDonofer @qldhealth 9 people have passed away due to the vaccine
34,"So 140 people had genuinely qualified for an exemption.

38,It has now come to pass if a hot MILF at the grocery asks about your vaccine status you have to see proof of hers? They're not making it as easy as it used to be and imagine turning down a solid eight or nine because she got injected but you have to! Say no to nines! üò¨

So where the bloody hell is the leadership?! https://t.co/FoEEENsxIR"
405,"It‚Äôs 6pm in #melbourne, and masks in the office aren‚Äôt that bad‚Ä¶ (could I pass as a surgeon?). Let‚Äôs hope this is under control in a few days, and we can get some more vaccines in the arm of under 50‚Äôs! #COVID19Aus #COVID19 https://t.co/sUqRB6ULxc"
406,"@laurie_ms @beyondbeeton They won‚Äôt ask you when you go to get the vaccine. As long as you pass the eligibility checker and book your time slot from there, you‚Äôre golden"
407,"@boypage Other vaccines will probably be approved in AUS before Pfizer is available to 50+. I wonder if they ask for proof of age at the mass vac sites, you could pass as under 50."
408,"@IanLowryThink32 I just think it's crazy you can still catch it and pass it on even if your fully vaccinated yet there's a big propaganda train saying get vaccinated and get vaccine passports and you can get your freedom back, but you actually can't."
409,"Who's thinking Scott Morrison is setting up a trap for our Premiers this Monday at National cabinet?

I'm sure they must be ready for him to pass all responsibilities to them for vaccine rollout .. hopefully they are ready for him"
410,"National cabinet to return to 'war footing' in effort to fix problem-plagued COVID vaccine rollout https://t.co/6LHw0ZD0gS

#auspol

Time to pass the buck to the States again. 
No care &amp; no responsibility politics of vaccines."
411,"@adamajacoby He had two jobs: establishing a quarantine system (which he passed to the states) and rollout and coordinate a national vaccine program (which we still haven‚Äôt got despite 12 months to plan) 
/shakes head"
412,@goodfoodgal Same vaccine that your local doctor can‚Äôt give ? Think I will pass !
413,"@katy3710 Yes but what about the ones you will affect and even kill ,because if you are no protected you can get it and pass on ,this mean is not only your choice you will be affecting some else because of your selfish actitude the percent to be safe with vaccine is to high to ignore"
414,@more_unicorns_g @StevePriceMedia @constan10101 If I got Covid because I refuse the vaccine are more chances I pass to my wife if I have tge vaccine I will no get Covid or Better say les chances of get Covid ?is that right?
415,@mitchdurie1 @richieplz @spartytalkback This is certainly fast - but absolutely not ‚Äòrushed‚Äô. Never before have medical efforts been so uniformly mobilised. This has passed every single step that any other vaccine has passed.
416,@StevePriceMedia @constan10101 Do the people don‚Äôt want the vaccine are ok? They Dan kill my wife she has no amune system if one of this people give  Covid to her will Kill her is not only them is people like us they are selfish and what we should go if one of them pass Covid ???
417,"For all those antixvaxers out there who are scared of the pzier vaccine. No it hasn't  been rushed, yes it has been studied, yes it has been trialled, yes it passed testing and approval and yes you can sue if you acquire a legitimate vaccine injury. Of course you will need proof https://t.co/GWYSyKvexh"
418,"Looking forward to seeing the published data/details. Just 0.04% of Israelis caught #COVID -19 after two shots of Pfizer vaccine. 371 out of 715,425 Israelis who passed at least a week after receiving 2 doses Pfizer¬†#coronavirus¬†vaccine contracted virus. https://t.co/ZlxzucFHIk"
419,"Seems the vaccine wars are heating up as the days pass. People's expectations were, I think, unrealistic re timing (see next tweet). As this article highlights, manufacturing vaccines is not the same as manufacturing orange juice. #covid19

420,"@JoshButler Wait. I have an idea. Let‚Äôs pass legislation to allow emergency use of vaccines. Like the rest of the world. 

Too radical?"
421,"@SHamiltonian Hi Steve,  key reasons:
1.  see if &amp; which vaccines prevent transmission.  Trials only show that YOU are protected, not if you still pass on the virus to others.
2. Pfizer requires dry ice cold chain, so roll out can‚Äôt be in GP / chemist level.
3. Single dose better acceptance"
422,"""Pfizer and BioNTech say their vaccine is '95% effective' and has passed safety checks"" No pharmaceutical companies - again - do not define national borders. https://t.co/GdrvH3rQDH"
423,"@iammarkcarnegie I‚Äôm so pro vaccine it hurts but would you take this Russian Hot Shot? 

I would probs pass."
424,"Covid-19 fun facts:
¬ß Kids catch and pass on the virus, same as adults.
¬ß 5% die of the virus and  a further 10% will be left with a chronic health problem.
¬ß Virus eradication is the lowest cost option.
¬ß There has never been a vaccine for a corona virus."

426,"#Vaccines currently in Phase II of the clinical trial process, meaning they are being tested on hundreds of people of various age groups to determine their effectiveness and safety. If they pass this stage they move to wider testing in Phase III, the final step before approval. https://t.co/wliysFn1jp"
