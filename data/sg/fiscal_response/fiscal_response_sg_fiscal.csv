44,"We need fiscal measures that build confidence and increase consumption, we have to put money into people‚Äôs pocket, create positive sentiments. We have to increase the tax base and maybe cutting the taxes rather than increasing them is going to help."
45,@DrAMSinghvi I am sure those that understand your point are also tuned in and hence perhaps a separate address by the FM and her team focusing on the fiscal provisions must follow.
46,@TonyNashOnAsia I think it's a bet that fiscal stimulus will include building roads and train tracks like it was in 2008.
