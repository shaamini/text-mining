391,@IndradeepKhan @kdayalan @vikramchandra Not imported cases but migrant workers from India Bangladesh and China staying in dormitories densely packed who picked up from some cluster in Singapore (allegedly little India) and spread ..
392,"@marcwebber @andydurrant75 I'd have lockdowned the country, not the people. From the first case shut our borders, then contact and trace every case that may have slipped through. If we had got a cluster develop, isolate that area like China did with Whuhan."
393,Shopping mall xspatutnya buka üò™ org boleh je nk beli online.. nnti ada cluster mall pulak..

395,"@Megankstack @moeffju I don‚Äôt know? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Most places here are air-con &amp; the spread could be majorly indoors. No cluster was announced so far as ‚Äúgathering under the blue sky‚Äù? I don‚Äôt know, I see your point, and the sun theory could be wrong. But SG‚Äôs spread could also be indoor, caused by air cons. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
396,@AmeeraAynie I pun tk tau.  Mungkin sebab ada banyak cluster dekat mcd
397,"@pansosgarislucu @ainunnajib Di Singapura, meski jumlah yg terinfeksi banyak, Karena ketika ada satu cluster Astana terinfeksi, mereka langsung mass testing. Yg gak ada gejala pun ditest. &amp; yg terinfeksi ini diisolasi, dipisahkan antara yg sehat &amp; terinfeksi, negara di ‚Äòlockdown‚Äô sampai juni."

400,"@shahrizan_k Rumours. Altho I kinda sure and won‚Äôt surprised. The surprise part was yesterday. But after they explained it‚Äôs cluster, it makes sense."
401,@sagarikaghose Are you aware of the cluster which have created the cases in MP or is it your ussual vile attack on @BJP4India @ChouhanShivraj without any facts ??
402,"Worry not, guys. The 728 cases yesterday and 1k cases today are just a cluster of people who are living together. Not untraceable sort of infected people. It‚Äôs expected. Apparently it is under control. Let‚Äôs just hope as such."
403,"@shiben @MrProWestie @lionhart4xtreme We built a massive compute cluster at work and after it was done, everyone had one question - ""Yes, but can it play crysis"" ( an irrelevant question in this context) !! It's become the pinnacle of performance for any computing system !!"
404,i am honestly concerned for the workers who have been living in the dorms :/ it seems like ... for the locals it's slowly getting more controlled? but the dorms cluster is crazy high D:

406,"The circuit breaker measures (from what I understand) is almost like trying to eliminate all possibilities of unlink cases, give authorities some time to establish tracing for the linked clusters, only then the spread from one known cluster to a yet to be cluster will be stopped."
407,"@JJ_Angelus üòÇ one chicken one duck indeed. I see many updates where cases are shifted from 1 cluster to another, probably due to language issues. Huge update last night, so will take me some time to update later. Hopefully by noon."

411,There's visual in twitter that suggests @ThanthiTV displaying the name of a COVID patient. Is it allowed @Vijayabaskarofl @rsprasad? While TN govt doesn't even want to mention the cluster name that has contributed to over 80% cases in TN; how's a channel displaying patient's name
