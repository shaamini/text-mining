Person without mask sneezes, the virus can travel quite a distance and if it falls on ur face n u r not wearing a mask u may get sick. If u wear a mask, the virus has a harder time having direct access to ur nose/mouth."
2414,@Clear_Liqueur Not true. We have seen video experiments. Any mask serves a protection to the wearer. Of course the higher the quality the better. A normal surgical mask will prevent more droplets out when a person wearing it sneezes and it does the same for the person on the receiving end.
2415,"@Clear_Liqueur Mask does protect the wearer. If someone without a mask were to sneeze at u and u r wearing a proper mask, the risk of u catching anything from him is definitely lesser than without a mask."
