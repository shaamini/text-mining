今回もしKTVが原因でロックダウンとなったら膝どころか心から崩れ落ちそう。"
159,"Singaporean really no linked. What has it got to do with teo Heng..

Anything also want to say to make govt look bad.

It's not as if they dun allow Teo Heng to do singing and KTV shop to do singing

Not even the same thing they comparing.. 

Teo Heng can pivot to other business"
160,"HR told me during PH dont go KTV. Knn, u want me kena slap by my wife ah?"
161,"The current #KTV Cluster is only one of many, even more common when our borders reopens.

In order to progress into the New Normal, getting #vaccinated is the best way moving forward. So if you still haven’t gotten your vaccination, please consider https://t.co/XRWy4fvfza https://t.co/LHajlpZ9rf"
162,"Situation looks quite good! 

It's really down to our fast NET we have Put in place!

Taiwan cases shoot up to few hundreds from their KTV cluster cos their system more porous.

Ours we put detection sensor at many places, even with patron reluctance to come out testing."
163,"There were 42 new local coronavirus cases confirmed as at Thursday noon (July 15), including 33 cases linked to the growing cluster linked to KTV and nightclubs here.

17 were linked to previous cases and quarantined while 20 were linked and detected

5 unlinked"
164,Similar strategy to close it as those cases.. the contact info will be fuller than KTV cases.
165,"Today cases got dropped.

Really a result of fast testing and contact tracing despite patron high chance of evading govt ..

Once we capture bulk of KTV people through cajoling them and telling them it's confidential.

Then rest of fires of cluster resulted from KTV we can do"
166,So I’ve been told that I should be nicer and empathetic to the (irresponsible)people that were involved in the KTV cluster
167,"When you see outside people today so relax!

U know that the KTV sex hungry people is that why so relax when they visit the hostess!"
168,"Expert . 

You think this is the movie Minority report?

We got holy trinity of 10 minute forecaster Lim Tean, Kirsten Han and Pritam Singh connected to Circular dish separated by 120°, projecting images of where virus is heading , then ball will come down, LHL reads ""KTV lounge"" https://t.co/Qma0rNq2N4"
169,"Shops at all times is it?
You will volunteer meh?

When covid now breaks at KTV, then we have to act nimbly to shift resources.

This is called resource optimisation. Endemic living.

Where is you all hindsight warrior when there is 0 and 1 daily covid case??

All hindsight"
170,"Really when come to twitter is become instantaneous politician Sia.

Just casually say KTV cluster is caused by lack of enforcement."
171,The latest outbreak of Covid cases in Singapore involves a string of KTV bars and social hostesses. Contact tracing this will make for some interesting conversations.
172,Imagine sg going through another heightened alert cuz some men went ktv 🥲🥵
173,Harap those tipu wife beh gi yg KTV ngan hostress cerai ah!!! hehehe
174,"The first wave is to clear out the KTV hostess and horny men group and family or flatmates whom they stay with.

Once first wave is sent to facility or hospital already

The second wave is to catch all the downstream infections and those in hiding. 

Now the KTV weak link"
175,"So far orchard road, beach road, Balestier , TOA payoh, Bugis-Little India (Middle Road) is related to KTV Vietnamese social hostess

So basically central Singapore. 

Is basically my area of concern for me

Damn!! 

Covid has shifted from Western Central to dead center central"
176,"Singaporeans dunno the govt has to handle infinite number of interest group.

It's easy to scold this and scold that. 

Over simplify and blame govt never shut down KTV and prevent them from operating totally in whatever form.

Every single interest group govt has to balance"
177,"In 20 years, Mediacorp might make a series about the KTV Covid Cluster due to one hostess..

To be titled - Madame Butterfly.."
178,"Blame to KTV people or Vietnam hostess.

So govt is literally being whacked left and right no matter which side they moved live right now as it is happening.....

Hard luck being govt or leader!!!

I really want to fuck citizens. Talk big but all dun dare to take political mantle"
179,"Singaporeans are just jealous and eating sour grapes cos they also deep inside want to Siam Diu all the way YOLO and hedonistic knob turn way the way max to polygamy .

Now acting righteous scold those KTV people. 

On the flip side. Another group is scolding govt for pushing"
180,"To be honest. KTV cluster is just another very viral issue now.

All people are using this issue.

At the end of the day. This too shall passed. 

And then there will be another next saga. And another. And another. And another. Most people are milking it.

It's not as if it"

If Singapore govt did not make pub business go out of business , our covid would be worse.

But pub , ktv shops changed to food outlet type and go rogue with inventions to entice male customer"
205,"To be frank. After the power Bukit merah.

I was totally puzzled we could maintain so low number like 1 unlinked case per day for a period given that we allowed done in since 21 June. 

The vietnam socialised ktv lady causing cluster is the normal thing.

In Korea, taiwan"
206,"The latest covid cluster is not surprising

Market shop owner
Food outlet

And now
