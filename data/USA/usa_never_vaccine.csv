2,@tottwriter @patrushkaz @chrischirp @ashishkjha I get what your saying but the virus has mutated how many times since 3/20?  Vaccines are still effective and just like the flu vaccines have to be updated so can these vaccines in my opinion so we never go back to square 1.

5313,@realDonaldTrump About the roll out of the vaccine... can we get that moving you are woefully behind schedule or have you decided that is no longer - or never was - your priority?
5314,So you should wear a copper hat with copper cable going down to the ground so in case you get hit by lightning you will be grounded. And you certainly should never drive a car. But you want everyone to get a vaccine that is maybe 95% effective for a illness that is 98.8% survival https://t.co/vpwHAYzEQJ
