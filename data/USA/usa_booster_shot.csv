9284,@DieJedi @CEJRyanMcMahon @OnondagaCounty The fact you assume I’m a democrat for saying the vaccines work is funny. I’m not. The data shows they work. I get an annual flu shot.

12768,@williamlegate Just had my booster. First it was just a sore arm. I did have a slight headache - not bad. Then I slept for 14 hours! So similar to my second shot.

12771,"@cinloou7 @Amy_Siskind Ah, I did Pfizer shots and a maderna booster and I was sick for three days."
12772,"So def plan mRNA booster when you can take it easy the next day, esp if you had any systemic side effects with the primary series. As with #2, Moderna booster side effects vary widely. For some, half dose = milder. I wasn't so lucky 😂 But all good 36 hrs post-shot. https://t.co/nUCJ5F1Hri"
12773,@Amy_Siskind My first shot produced claddic symptoms over 24 hours. The second did but not as fierce. I'm thinking about going Pfizer for booster as I've had a health issue going on 3 months now and my immunity has dropped.
12774,@trvrb @CDCgov below is spot on. Got double vaxxed at county site with end of day doses both times. Got booster at pharmacy and am now getting reminders for second dose. All 3 shots might have been counted as first doses. https://t.co/i3fORJH9YM
12775,@Amy_Siskind No side effects! The booster is 1/2 the regular shot!
12776,@KatiePhang @Amy_Siskind All 3 of mine were Moderna.  No problem with 1st 2.  Got my regular flu shot at the same time I got my booster. I had body aches and headache. Lasted &lt;24hrs..

23878,@Ben_Baby It’s common for people who has had covid to react to the first shot as if it were the booster. For those who have not had it typically have the reaction on the second shot. There are a lot of other factors but this has been found to be true more often than not.
23879,@labyrinthweaver I’m not sure if “booster” is the right term to use technically. The mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna can be readily updated to code fir variant proteins. These third shots would be to broaden the spectrum of resistance.
23880,"@Death_Of_Nuance @freespiritus Before telling others the virus will magically disappear in couple months, you should do basic research.

24234,@Sloths7777 Yes. Until Variants are under control and we get a booster shot.
24235,I still remember getting that “booster shot” with a black gun looking thing with the needles.

24251,@TeachAndi Yep that seems to be a pretty big consensus. My concern about laminating would be booster shots.

24269,@AustinCrute Another J&amp;J advantage: there is strong evidence that a second shot can be its own booster against future strains. The Pfizer and Modena vaccines may need to be boosted with something as yet not invented.
24270,@sodakpeace I’m still not convinced getting this shot is the right thing to do. It feels like we still don’t know a lot of what to expect because it’s so new. And the idea of “booster” shots only affirms my concerns.
24271,"@eastnary @Futuredizzy Well, there ARE competitors (i.e. Moderna) with the same technology.  That should help.  Also, with the virus mutating, booster shots with revised mRNA sequences will be needed.  Flu vaccines have never gone away, and these will continue to be needed."
24272,@samantha_cass @AstasDelights @BogochIsaac Maybe it would necessitate booster shots at some point. Variants we don't know about yet could also arise.

24505,"Epiphany falls on January 6th, which also happens to be the day (🤞) I get my Covid-19 trial booster shot. I'm taking this coincidence as a good sign!"
24506,Another reason to get the GSK Shingrix vaccine 2 booster if &gt;50 or 1 shot if under 50. We could eliminate this horror if everyone took the 1 shot but 1st eliminate COVID19. https://t.co/OuWkVYvfAm
24507,"&amp; I mean only 10M people can get vaccinated right off the bat if both doses are reserved for just one person. More doses will be on the way soon

However the numbers I’m giving you obviously came from empty promises

so we have 14M doses for first shot &amp; the booster, right? 2/?"
24508,"@drmartin66 @robyn_s_lee No, we should not do away with the 2nd shot! What is being discussed at the moment is whether spacing the 2nd shot more than what the trial shows would be good or not! Booster is required!"
24509,"Y’all, there are a lot of vaccines that require more than one dose. That why parents of young children often get worked up about this. Do y’all not remember booster shot day at the pediatrician as a kid? You got McDs on the way home AND YOU DIDNT DIE OF MEASLES."
24510,Grateful for health care workers! My lovely oncologist and nurses gave me good news today. White count was high &amp;  I won’t need to come back to the hospital for a booster shot tomorrow! some good news at the end of 2020. 🎉
24511,"Effectively, it could be up to *6 weeks* before your body builds up immunity due to requiring a booster shot. During that time, you can STILL get infected. Don’t be surprised that media outlets jump on this sort of sensationalism, because dummies will use it for justification https://t.co/10jdAuT7n2"
24512,"@HappyFunNorm In the study the first shot was even higher than 70% effective after 10 days. Closer to 90-95%. I think it was about 50% effective btw 5-9 days. Second shot is the booster for longevity, I believe."
24513,"I don’t always go to the hospital, but when I do, it’s for the COVID-19 vaccination (or the booster shot).

24514,@Kelleyrose20 I'm ready for a booster shot! ☺️
24515,"@BRIANJ32 @_lunardreams I got Moderna. Only side effects was a sore arm. NOW, the booster I have to get in 28 days from the first shot, that’s going to make me achy and tired. 

The body will think it’s under attack from Covid and will try to fight it off. This build up the immunity."
24516,"@_lunardreams Getting the first does of Covid drops the contagion Percentage from 100 to 50. After the booster, it’s down to almost 1%. After the phase 3 case study was done, after the second shot, 1 person out of 60 contracted Covid. The shot works. Work real well."
24517,"@Nick34shady Yep, I got mine last week. It’s a 2 shot vaccination. The booster is 21 to 28 days after your first and it is going to make you a bit under weather cause the immune system is responding how it’s supposed to."
24518,@FakeDawnSummers @PhillyB322 There’s not going to be a single dose shot. It has to be 2 for the booster.

24520,Actually not. They run the very real risk of making the first dose ineffective without the second booster shot. A false sense of doing something while in fact harming recipients. Politicians should never make these decisions. https://t.co/J1I8YN3TIu
24521,"#NEW Follow up booster shots have already been scheduled for those living in long term care facilities. The vaccine is optional to residents, but 95% of residents at a Tega Cay home opted in for the COVID-19 vaccine. @FOX46News https://t.co/tzp9GihHcU"

24527,"@emilyeich7 Nice!! 👏🏼 

I’m in the Pfizer vaccine trial, so I’ll find out in early March if I was vaccinated or not.

Both seem to work well but the Moderna one seems much more practical with the higher storage temp.

It’ll be interesting to see how often we need a booster shot long term."
24528,But more doesn’t mean protection. The second shot is a booster to the first and must be administered within the correct timeline or immunity is a turkey shoot. https://t.co/B7wMdtw73q

24530,"To clarify, there's no evidence yet that mRNA vaccines like Pfizer's or Moderna's will offer protection against #COVID19 longer than 1yr or even less. Booster shots may be needed  every 3 months, 6 months, or a year, depending on age of patient.

24532,@_wheresANDRE And i agree with this point. Its not about need and is an economic booster shot. Thats why i dont like the complaining about the amount. Especially when we know we just took money out the hands of the people with a real need.

24540,"@RealDoctorMike Hey Dr. Mike. I was wondering, what is the difference between a vaccine and a booster shot? Vaccines are said to expose the body to the certain virus at hand. Is this so the body can produce antibodies? Doesn't the body make antibodies after you've been sick? ❤"

24546,@saruhhhdanae Don’t forget about the booster shot as well.
24547,"@john_jseagraves I was 5 or 6 when I got the Salk vaccine. I think there was a booster shot, but it might have been for some other vaccine. I was either 12 or 13 when I got the Sabine sugar cube."
24548,"@JForma @TheDietIsOff @Lisa6264 I should change my language to he suggested, I guess they are saying protection is high after the first shot. The booster is the one that causes the antibody response. Who knows how long it all lasts though"

24552,"@Informed_Un Repeat vaccine doses trigger body to produce more Abs against pathogen, as well as a robust supply of memory cells which stay in body a LONG time. 

These multi initial doses are diff from booster shot (tetanus, diphtheria): creating initial response harder than renewing old one."
