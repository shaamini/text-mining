1,"@soopajx it's the idea that catching the virus will create immune response at least as good or even better than being vaccinated. however like you're saying, this (1) ignores vulnerable immunocompromised folks, and (2) has been shown false with Covid as people are getting re-infected."
2,"Wear you masks, live your life. If you are immunocompromised find things you love to do that don't require socializing amongst the idiots. They will weed themselves out eventually.  And for the love of GOD, VOTE!"

4,"@joncoopertweets Yes. 
I never wore a mask to obey a mandate.

I wear my mask to stay healthy for myself and to not catch COVID then unintentionally infect others, some of whom might be immunocompromised and therefore unable to develop a safe level of immunity even after vaccinations."
5,"@joncoopertweets Yes, im immunocompromised and also care about others"
6,"For our #immunocompromised pts h/t @VPrasadMDMPH-- there is no one size fits all re- VAX dosing/time/holding meds-Evusheld-level of precautions etc"" These discussions require a personal physician whom you trust"" Cant agree more!! @AWIRGROUP @CreakyJoints @AutoimmuneList"
7,@WiShBoNeZ @TorontoStar Except that's not how this works. The expectation of safety is then solely put on immunocompromised people. Are you really that selfish? Is there absolutely no one in your life worth protecting? No one immunocompromised in your family or friend group? Not willing to protect them?

9,"Today at the Mansion, I hosted children with disabilities who live in foster care settings for an arts &amp; crafts event ahead of Valentine‚Äôs Day. These children are newly eligible for special grant funding.

10,"@DelloJak The truth coming out after 2 yrs is the virus is not as serious as they made it out to be dear man. Comparable to the flu and it's level of severity for the vulnerable, elderly, immunocompromised etc. I am very sorry to hear of your health challenges &amp; hope you recover soon."
11,"I refuse to live in a country where we leave immunocompromised Americans behind because some people are clamoring to ""get back to normal.""

17,"@joncoopertweets Yes, because I am immunocompromised. I don‚Äôt produce enough antibodies to keep me safe from upper respiratory infections. I do receive IVIG but my numbers are still low."
18,"@DrLeanaWen So‚Ä¶kids can just mask up when their parents don‚Äôt approve? Elderly patients in long term care can choose their masks with certainty?  Teachers including those who are immunocompromised can make the kids breathing on them mask up?

28,"@leighbeadon @cardassianv0le @Thesixler @drvolts There‚Äôs no highly uncertain future. A lot more idiots will continue to die because they didn‚Äôt get vaxxed. And just like with the flu the immunocompromised will be more susceptible which sucks bad but it is what it is. It‚Äôs never going away, and society won‚Äôt conform much longer."
29,"@Wzbad22 @RKSAlberta @SteveRickettsSP Now you're just being obtuse, and I'm saying that from a home dealing with a breakthrough delta case.

So basically what you're saying is screw everyone who's immunocompromised or predisposed to serious illness, despite being vaccinated, because the plague rats need to play."

32,"@Bob_Wachter So, Bob, do you really feel that unmasking is okay to do even in the hospital where there might be immunocompromised individuals (even if the risk is low)? And does it seem unreasonable to ask individuals to mask up in ""stranger"" crowds for at most 2-3 hours?"
33,"@KunstJonas Do you expect *everyone* to isolate and hide forever?

Let the immunocompromised decide for themselves how to navigate covid."
34,"This, of course, doesn't address the burden on the immunocompromised, and personally, I'll continue to wear a mask indoors until Covid rates are much lower. But from this perspective, it does look more like assessing real risk and less like pandering to the media before midterms."
35,"@davidwpeddle @TashaKheiriddin @DominicCardy @JustinTrudeau Imagine being an immunocompromised child, knowing that your father puts his belief in conspiracy theories above your health and well-being. Ending mandates should be based on hospital capacity and rate of infection."
36,"@joncoopertweets Yes. Although I'm vaxxed/boosted, I'm immunocompromised in a state with - maybe if you stretch it - a 50% vax rate. Not to mention that I could still carry it to someone else. My state/city has NEVER seen majority vaxxed OR masked. #COVID=learning not to trust your neighbors."

47,"@atxhappygirl @coalsmom @mattdpearce The bigger picture: Most Americans never give a thought that we are sharing spaces with immunocompromised people. 3-4% of the population.

514,"Once children 6mo-4yr can be vaccinated, it‚Äôs really the beginning of the end. All apologies to the immunocompromised, but there was never anything that could have been done for them besides social distancing and mask mandates.

516,"@Dianne37467713 @yaya_gumbo @cspanwj No, this is so anti-VAX lunatics don‚Äôt kill immunocompromised people. Don‚Äôt you understand that vaccines for other illnesses are required for healthcare workers annually?"
517,a work event with probably 100 people will likely be inside. people will be drunk. this isn't until April but I'm already thinking about whether I will fight to not go. I'm (maybe) not immunocompromised but my spouse is. we likely already have long covid.
518,@b_mcguire @MelissaGill999 @RadioFreeTom You might save the life of an elderly immunocompromised person in the grocery store.
519,"@dinnerwithjulie Yup. It‚Äôs business as usual for us immunocompromised seniors. Year 3 - Stay in isolation, grocery pickup, food delivery. Same shit, different year."
520,"When people say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to move on from the pandemic,‚Äù do they mean they‚Äôre ready to put friends, family, and co-workers at risk? They‚Äôre ready to endanger the fragile and immunocompromised and disabled? And children too young to be vaccinated? Thanks, asking for a friend."

522,"@RadioFreeTom You are forgetting that they aren't just killing themselves, they are spreading it to family, close friends and even strangers and some, like young children and the immunocompromised, that can't be vaccinated to protect themselves. It is cruel and selfish behavior."

529,"@ThomasAgoritsas @BallouxFrancois Yeah I'd imagine post-Covid symptoms are a huge problem with immunocompromised.  I'm double vaxxed + prior Alpha infection &amp; post-Omicron 6 weeks later still not 100%, and I'm under 40 in excellent shape."

533,"@DavidAFrench I don't really care for how he completely dismisses the concerns for the immunocompromised. Society already was ableist against them pre-pandemic, now it's worse."
534,"@Sue_Innovates @tconnors56 @CheriDiNovo @CovidEcoles @fordnation I want to know if Hamilton list reflects what ON's list will be. Two groups have been dropped from NACI recommendations:

- those who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 because of their race or marginalization
- immunocompromised state, with specific list of conditions."
535,"I hate how many people, across the world, feel the same way I do about being immunocompromised. But I‚Äôm glad that I‚Äôm not alone in feeling this way."

537,@wutrain @BostonSchools @MYCBoston Exactly! Many immunocompromised kids and data are not enough reassuring mayor Wu. At BPS every week we have new positive cases how could it possibly be safe taking masks off? We all are tired but safety comes first since they still don‚Äôt believe in vaccine

The outbreaks were also small because the only susceptible were unvaxxed and immunocompromised."
540,No one should be teaching children that it's cowardice to ask them to wear a mask or get vaxxed to protect the immunocompromised people around them. Not sure why it's such a hot take to suggest we try to get vax rates up in the 5-12 age group before telling them to unmask. https://t.co/C840gBzMzD
541,@nathaliejacoby1 Yes twice. Vaccinated 3 times. My second time was easier after being vaccinated. I am immunocompromised.

543,"@cryborg If the gov't gets the blame, they'll just shrug it off. There is no consequence for them.  Lifting the mandate is an horrific decision and one that we will have to suffer. As an immunocompromised RN, I doubt I will ever go out again without an N95 until this virus is eradicated."
544,"I'm immunocompromised and I'm not expendable, and neither are the other 10 million of us. #WearADamnMask #1of10million"
545,"@CanadianH3R0 @ggreenwald If you are immunocompromised you can die from anything. If you are, wearing an actual N95+ was always a good idea, and still is. As long as your using it properly. Everyone else doesn't have to go around wearing masks to solve that."
546,I guess we should just stop all transplants since the immunocompromised are going to die anyway. May as well put the resources to palliative care and let them die a little quicker. https://t.co/dVytZoQZXp
547,@BallouxFrancois The only positive thing for immunocompromised is: it can't kill you twice.
548,@Captaincoby00 Me. Immunocompromised.
549,"@ASlavitt You just won't stop making things worse for us.

Guess who's missing from your ""rosy"" picture above? 0-5 that can't be vaxxed. Immunocompromised. Medically fragile but would live for years more without this disease.

The majority of the public supports mask mandates."
550,# sotrovimab losing efficacy against BA.2? Very worrisome- time to unmask! If true immunocompromised have only one hard to find therapeutic- had to be taken within 5 days of first symptom and has tons of severe drug interactions including hard to stop anti-coagulants. https://t.co/cCfTLyvj6u

Of those, 117 patients - or 57% - are admitted to the hospital primarily for non-COVID reasons.
Of the 205, 48 are vaccinated, 28 of whom are immunocompromised transplant patients."
557,@NikkoleHughes @victoriaregisk @lmlauramarsh An not just deaths of immunocompromised or unaccounted. The reason they stopoed counting breakthroughs mobrhs ago is vecause this NEVER was a pandemic of unvaxed. Right now about 20% of deaths on avg are from breakthroughs. Still more than 3k dead a day.
558,MOST IMPORTANT. #immunocompromised patients- make a plan now! Call your doctor and make sure they know where to find and how to safely prescribe #Paxlovid and #Sotrovimab monoclonals. Get tests - antivirals have to be given w/in 5 days first symptom and mAb w/in 10
559,@NikkoleHughes @victoriaregisk @lmlauramarsh Definitelt for those of us whoa re immunocompromised or not able to get the vax or boosters for underlying reason- but make no mistake the increased pressure to srop countinf cases and deaths and relax the few mitigations they were even suggesting will result in continued deaths
560,"@Clarja_wewon 1000000%, I get it people want this to be over but we can‚Äôt just ignore Covid and hope it just goes away. And we don‚Äôt just have to live with it. There‚Äôs still immunocompromised people who would love to not have to worry about leaving their houses for anything."

565,@RadioFreeTom I've been masking less for non vaxxed and more for immunocompromised. Folks without a healthy immune system have been begging us to just wear masks without whining so yeah I'm going to do that and encourage my fellow humans to just be kind for a while more.

568,@SabinehazanMD @LetsTalkSht I've been following and think this is very interesting. We have 5 kids (4-18) at home and have had PCR confirmed COVID in-house 3 times. Our immunocompromised PANDAS daughter never got it. Already takes fluvoxomine and Azithromycin daily as part of her treatment regimen.
569,"@MSNBC Speaking of misinformation I see @MSNBC has joined the ‚Äúget on with your lives‚Äù narrative. Guess the country doesn‚Äôt care about the immunocompromised, you‚Äôve sentenced them to a lifetime of isolation."
570,"@ThisOffendsMeTV @unclecousinjoe @CamiLee13 I can answer. I have faith the vaccine will make it less likely I'll get sick, but I may still pass it on to others, and I*can* still get sick myself. When you are immunocompromised, your calculus is different. You did read he has a liver disease that makes him high risk, right?"
571,"@victoriaregisk Thank you for asking the question about the #immunocompromised. Two years of earnest masking and isolation. My life is grocery runs and dr visits. Can't find #4thshot or #Evusheld. Oh, we're dropping mask mandates now? Bring on the #maskholes.

577,"@2Spaceninja15 @VerifyThis And technically, for under 50, you're right. 1% death rate or lower - if vaccinated. However that is sickeningly disrespectful and evil to treat older and immunocompromised people that way. They matter. They don't get sentenced to death for YOU."

5170,@johnrobertsFox You should be focused on the fact that people need to be vaccinated to protect people who are immunocompromised like Colin Powell
5171,@EricTopol @johnrobertsFox Roberts is completely ignoring the fact that Powell had cancer and was immunocompromised.  They should be focused on the fact that society should be vaccinated to protect people like this .
5172,@johnrobertsFox What part of he had cancer and was immunocompromised do you not understand?
5173,@johnrobertsFox Powell had cancer and was immunocompromised dude . It‚Äôs not the same as someone else getting a vaccine. This is the fault of the unvaxxed. Society gets vaccinated to protect people like this .
5174,@lsullyr @Frogs_Are_Good @LindseyGrahamSC Apparently you need to learn the word ‚Äúimmunocompromised.‚Äù
5175,@SteveSkojec @OhNoSheTwitnt Not that you care but he was immunocompromised (cancer) therefore his body wasn‚Äôt able to mount the same immune response to the vax most people are. This is why even those not at high risk need the vax‚Äîthe less the virus is circulating the safer people like him are.
5176,"@ImmortalLou30 Always quick to point out immunocompromised/age as a factor for the total numbers/anti-vax reasons. Yet, this is exactly when it's a factor so they'll leave that out."
5177,"@TimFullerton @Rick209AC ‚Ä¶&amp; people were saying that Covid kills anyone ‚Ä¶ not just the immunocompromised or elderly. 

Your issue with the narrative is in conflict with that now that the vaccine is available. 

Not a fan of people taking both sides of the same argument when it‚Äôs convenient."
5178,"@stphnfwlr Not to mention the fact that those who refuse to get vaccinated increase the risk for all of us, especially immunocompromised people like Gen Powell."
5179,@nytimes To be clear Colin Powell was fully vaccinated but contracted COVID19   which is called a Breakthrough case.He also had Multiple Myeloma which is a rare blood cancer thus making him immunocompromised. The more Americans vaccinated the less chance of infecting the immunocompromised
5180,@deleterious_2 @MarketWatch He had #cancer (&amp; #Parkinsons) and was immunocompromised‚Ä¶. If you actually did the research this is the importance of why it‚Äôs absolutely imperative everyone #GetVaccinated.

5185,@dcopaken @RebeccaSoffer @nytimes Saw so many articles this morning which didn‚Äôt even mention he had multiple myeloma. So important to explain that he was immunocompromised.
5186,@WalshFreedom All that good intelligent people can do is get the actual facts out. General Powell was severely immunocompromised from a blood cancer. All the more reason why vaccines are critical.

6188,"@Ubercapper This is similar to other vaccines for the immunocompromised, etc. So is herd immunity not achievable? Let‚Äôs look at NY. Of the ~15m eligible, 12.7m have 1 dose and 11.4m are fully vaccinated. That‚Äôs 75 and 76%, respectively - so why are we doing this?"

6190,@mjacobs324 @elizashapiro I‚Äôve called for a centralized remote option for kids under 12 and immunocompromised students. There already is a centralized process for home schooling so DOE knows how to get this done if there was willingness to develop a plan.

6192,@elizashapiro They are creating a centralized remote plan &amp; that option will be on the table for kids rather than worksheets for 10 days.

8710,"@mende_mark @va_shiva The real problem is that you have done shallow research on the subject &amp; are believing in a farce. I happen to have done years of research 4 my own health, recovering from an  immunocompromised state to good health &amp; I wish that on everyone, but can‚Äôt do the work for you."
8711,"@HARRISFAULKNER  I agree with the Healthcare workers, with the Elderly, but the OBESE? No Immunocompromised, yes."
8712,@EmagineShop It‚Äôs a loonnng story but I‚Äôm severely immunocompromised and got laid off back when my state got shut down because of Covid and can‚Äôt go back to work because of my health. Originally started this back in 2019 as a hobby but turned it into a business and it‚Äôs been supporting me ü§ó
8713,@P89DaPrince @user20956 @real_greg_brady @naima @ywebb2020 @RawlCealia @deray same for covid but the other way around. you‚Äôre more likely to die of it if you‚Äôre immunocompromised. still a covid death because without it you‚Äôd be alive.
8714,"@P89DaPrince @real_greg_brady @naima @ywebb2020 @RawlCealia @deray right. so if you have an illness that wrecks your immune system, and it compounds on top of another illness that makes you die, both of those conditions led to your death. Same for COVID. If you‚Äôre immunocompromised and COVID is able to kill you because of that, both killed you."
8715,@realPaulMay üëç if my dr advises it I will. I am considered immunocompromised and get all the vaccinations
8716,ok not to be dramatic but as an immunocompromised asthmatic person when I saw moderna started filing for permits for their vaccine I almost started sobbing
8717,@emily_fri And what fraction of ‚Äú? PCP ‚Äî GGO in immunocompromised pt‚Äù are successfully treated with Lasix?

8719,"Dear @AirbnbHelp, For some reason we can‚Äôt book anything on your app and we have never used it. We need an entire place to ourselves because we have somebody who is immunocompromised and your system keeps blocking us out. What. The. Fuck. https://t.co/I2dyfAfVOF"
8720,@thekoreanvegan I DO support them being BARRED from entering establishments 1) if they refuse to üò∑; 2) if they refuse to get vaccinated. There‚Äôs too much risk of their getting an immunocompromised or high-risk person severely ill.
