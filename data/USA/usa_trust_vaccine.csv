980,@DrewOnline @AdamStewart Just as the vaccines both are experimental with many doctors speaking of its positive results in treating Covid-19.   Who are u to determine what method anybody should trust or decide is best for them. We have dr who have had a 100% success rate using it here in Jamaica.
981,@EchoesofthePas1 @Brimshack @TimRunsHisMouth Yes Pfizer is known in medical circles as pretty reliable.  Would I trust moderna and J&amp;J not so much. But this is the most widely tested vaccine in a long time!  100s of millions of people got the vaccine!
982,"@drrandomguyy @BretWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg @clairlemon Good point maybe. I think what's at issue is that he is publicly pushing a narrative that is causing his listeners to not trust the vaccine, which could be deadly for some of them, and that maybe this should be discussed behind closed doors until a final verdict is reached."
983,"@B43Franco @MikePrysner @yopasta @BenjaminNorton Given, there's vaccine adverse event underreporting. But if your hypothesis is that the vax is worse than the disease, you go against medical expert consensus in countries all over the world.

2482,Biden went from saying he doesn't trust the vaccine to get vaxxed or lose your job...
2483,"The guy that is demanding #vaccines is the same guy that told us not to trust it last year. If this was #Trump doing this, you bet the #Democrats would be calling him a dictator. What a joke!"
2484,@JoeBiden today announced that he is putting measures In place to force unvaccinated people to get vaccinated or lose their jobs. He vilified the people who do not trust the highly politicized vaccine and was encouraging the vaccinated to  against discriminate the unvaccinated.
2485,Can someone play the videos of @POTUS @JoeBiden &amp; @VP @KamalaHarris saying “don’t trust the vaccine” / “I’m not taking the Trump vaccine”
2486,"Remember when some liberals (including our current Vice President) didn’t trust the vaccine because of Trump? Can you even imagine the reaction if he went out there and said “you will take this, or else. I’m losing patience!”

Oh, it’d be off the charts screaming tyrant."
2487,I trust Biden’s assurances about the vaccine about as much as his assurances that no American would be left in Afghanistan
2488,@J0eBidem YOU SAID ‘ do not trust the vaccine’  FIRST ! #facts   As if TRUMP WAS IN THE LAB MAKING THE DAMN THING .
2489,"When others want to force me to take a vaccine from questionable medical pros,asking me to trust Doctors.I am asking the same about ACES.Learn &amp; apply ACES to your experiences in k12 education. You don’t have to be public as I am or at all, in your own privacy&amp;ask your OH doctor."
2490,"@HuffPost Howard is 100% correct. 
If you didn't trust science and didn't get the vaccine, don't check in to a hospital once you get COVID"

2492,@phillhabsfan At this point nearly all the icu beds are filled with antivaxers. Trust me I'm angry too. There absolutely need to be measures taken such as vaccine passports.  Take away privileges and luxuries. Make it hard to be unvaccinated.  But Healthcare is a human right not a privilege
2493,"@overit_miss NOT…can’t trust it…sad thing is when/if a proven and approved vaccine DOES come along, how can I be sure they’re telling the truth?? Yes I know they “threw” an FDA approval on, only for the benefit of big pharma."
2494,"https://t.co/WW5jWwcoXz Almost anyone can claim to be an “expert” &amp;, unfortunately, too many of us are gullible. I trust what the CDC &amp; FDA say about Ivermectin. I believe we’re still better off getting protected against #COVID19 w/ the FDA-APPROVED VACCINES out there. #GetVaxxed"
2495,"Again,  I agree. Either you trust medical science or you don't.

If you don't trust the vaccine, then don't take an ICU bed when you're sick. Save the beds for people who trust medical science.

2497,@h_shriya @BogochIsaac My faith isn’t shattered either but I can’t say that for some ppl I’ve spoken to or overheard in passing in the past 18 months. How else do we explain ppl who got every other vaccine before but are now “C19 vaccine hesitant” it didn’t happen due to too much trust in leadership!

2501,one of my coworkers is super afraid of catching coronavirus and freaks out about it at work… but refuses to get the vaccine because she doesn’t trust it lol. make it make sense.

2508,"@davidfrum I've noticed that they do believe in vaccines, but only trust what they grew up with or has not been politicized. It's like people of a certain age that trust what is familiar &amp; not the new &amp; unfamiliar, esp. if there's neg. sociopolitical connotations."
2509,"So, we should not trust a vaccine that was studied and approved by the FDA for human use in fighting covid but we should trust a medication that has never been studied or approved by the FDA for human use in treating covid? Ummmm. Ok."
2510,But I've lost ALL trust in your News Stations and our Government and agencies. Shame on you to continue batchering people who've reasonably reservations against these Vaccines! And making us look like we're the cause of the problems! 3/4

2512,"@Crowesq @SaintRPh @hughknowit Your study had 72 participants and hasn’t been replicated. Also, it says helps with MILD symptoms. The group that got Ivermectin and the other drug saw no real difference compared to placebo group. So you trust that over a vaccine that has been studied longer amongst more ppl?"
2513,"@tjk_mla @ACLU We don't trust your science when it comes to this specific vaccine.  The masses don't as cases go up, this scientist and leaders dont seem to care about throwing my kids with the vaccinated kids.  Does that sound like good leadership or science?"
2514,@thehill Well a$$!!! If a vaccine is the answer. Plus you are vaccinated. Why does my  being unvaccinated matter? Your protected! My body. My choice. I do not trust this one. You can take mine. Get extra protected 🙄
2515,Why don’t you let personal doctors administer vaccines?  Don’t trust them?  Can’t control them all?  Too risky?  People feel safe and have intimate relationships with their family docs.  U MAKE NO SENSE. #AskdrdevillaCP24
2516,Lol whatever happened to having your own thoughts and opinions? If I don’t want the vaccine why do you care so fucking much about it? It’s MY choice and MY body… but you “trust science” lmaoooo. Shut up🥴😬
2517,@bepreparedalot @NewWombat We have a real issue in our country with just disregarding experts out of hand for *reasons*. Sorry I'll trust the 98% of Doctors who tell me a vaccine is safe and effective and that horse paste is a waste of time and could be harmful. But you do you
2518,"These MAGA idiots don't trust doctors when it comes to the vaccine, but whose the first person who they run to when they get sick"
2519,"@chedancer @PierreKory So you trust the one study conducted by the pharma company that shows their “vaccine” has a relative risk reduction of 95% and an absolute risk reduction of 1% (hidden from public), but you don’t trust 60 independent studies from professionals with no conflicts of interest?"
2520,"I have a coworker who is also in the medical field &amp; thinks the vaccine is poison. I said there's only like four ingredients. She said ""you trust the government?"" Same bitch was saying how it isn't FDA approved &amp; now that it is, she doesn't trust the government. 🤦‍♀️ get me tf out."
2521,"I can’t wrap my head around this… 

Vaccine that’s gone through rigorous testing and approvals at multiple levels and been used for 9 months in hundreds of millions of people: can’t trust it. 

Horse dewormer: let’s give it a shot.

I mean, have they tried Tide Pods yet?"
2522,"@Matt_Littlejohn I think there is a misconception that a vaccine prevents transmission. That’s never the case. It’s about keeping ppl alive, making it less severe if you contract the virus. But, I do agree the communication around Covid has been extremely poor which has rightfully eroded trust."
2523,@EdDevoe @DirtyTesla No not vaccinated. So many of my family members got the vaccine and then tested positive a few days later. Don't know who to trust. My grandmother is FULLY VACCINATED AND IS IN ICU
2524,Where’s your empirical evidence showing masks or vaccines don’t actually work? And don’t just say trust me bro.”

You are being mislead for political reasons and

2530,"If you’d rather take an animal dewormer because you trust that more than any of the COVID vaccines, please unfollow me."
2531,So I just can’t wrap my brain around this… you don’t trust the human vaccine for covid because human doctors but you want to take ivermectin because horse doctors are better? How did we get a country where people are dumber than kindergartners?
2532,@mehdirhasan There are a lot of people skeptical about the vaccine from all walks of life. To pin it to one group is wrong. There many people who don’t trust the government. Speaking of 9/11. People were told it was safe to go and help and work around the area. Turns out many people got sick
2533,@alanfryermedia Brain trust says lets make sure topics are those we know that Trudeau wants to use to hammer O'Toole - so guns and abortion and vaccine mandates and to be safe lets have CBC chief Trudeau cheerleader as moderator. there all set - and only 1 in English
2534,"I blame a lot of vaccine disinformation &amp; hesitancy on doctors.

There is no trust between the general public &amp; the medical field - because everyone understands that the medical field is an insurance racket.

Why would I trust doctors? I can’t even afford to go to them."
2535,This vaccine is available for anyone who CHOOSES to get stabbed....why is the vaccination rate SO LOW? Perhaps because people don't TRUST the USA Govt. and people don't TRUST Profit motivated BIG PHARMA. It is that simple. No Phd or Medical degree required.
2536,"@GeraltofUSA89 @RadioFreeTom All we liberals said was we didn't trust Trump and would wait on the FDA. in this situation, the vaccine is proving safe and effective. The companies have sold supply to the Government so they don't care if you get it or not. Get vaxxed."
2537,I really do not think anyone who is anti-vax is actually smart. They don’t trust modern medicine enough to get the vaccine but they trust it enough to seek help once they become sick.
2538,"@RcRegalstarfire To give me a vaccine I’m not taking no doctors word on that,they haven’t earned it as a collective profession.Treating 1 K12 condition as something it’s not,medically worsening the original condition becuz it’s their culture doesn’t warrant trust or respect for medical providers"

2542,"@Yeti1181 @JeromeAdamsMD She said she wouldn’t take Trump’s word on the vaccine if public health officials disagreed. That she would trust them instead. That is not being anti-vaccination, but pro science. Trump made a lot of stuff up."
2543,If you are buying covid medicine at the feed store but don't trust the vaccines........
2544,@LizHIVHep @michaelmina_lab @EricTopol Thanks. Those suggesting natural immunity isn’t effective are “experts” not experts. They’ve destroyed trust in public health &amp; vaccines. It’s not a noble lie because the harm far outweighs the benefit. The disadvantaged you referred to are also more likely to be vaccine hesitant

2550,I’ve heard so many stories this week of people adamantly against the covid vaccine and passing away from covid. I trust a vaccine and science way more than this virus. Seriously wondering wth people are thinking?! #getthevaccine 💉

2560,@RingeScott @beyouonlybetter Stories everywhere. I try to not focus on it all. You can make cases either way. If I die from a vaccine oh fucking well.

5005,@akshatsharma I'm honestly baffled by the pause because birth control has a much higher risk of clotting. I get it. They want to assess risk and give warnings just like with the pill. But it's going to cause a huge blowback to vaccine roll out. Too many people don't trust vaccines anyway.
