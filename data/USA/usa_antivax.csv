10466,@seanhannity kind of funny how you flipped your stance not only on Covid but also the vaccine. We all remember how anti vax you and Fox News were spreading misinformation. Now that 99% of the people who are hospitalized and dying are unvaccinated republicans you change opinions.

10475,"Watching Republican officials/pundits squirm into their “no, seriously, you have to get vaccinated” is surreal too little too late - lots of excuse making, blame shifting, and soft pedaling challenges to antivax. Not taking the latter head on prob just confirms faith in lies."
10476,"@GeorgeTakei @Marston4ca42 Never thought of that as  motivation for Fox's antivax rhetoric, but it makes sense. Blame it on Biden's pandemic response and damage him in the process. The only thing they missed was the killing off of their audience and right wing voters. 🤷🏽‍♂️"

It’s not just the hypocrisy, it actively undermines public confidence in these politicians’ capacity to evaluate risk. You’d think people would have learned from deblasio in March https://t.co/DMfXtPzRR5"
12246,@MaaloufMD It’s all of nutrition Twitter! Keto and vegan people have melded into one giant anti mask Covid denying anti vax group. Sad! Thanks friend ❤️❤️
12247,This is absolutely fucking deplorable. These antivax woman harassing a mother after she lost a child should be ashamed of themselves. https://t.co/RvrEykneDB
12248,@SolNataMD Sadly those are the physicians I see spreading antivax misinformation all over social media :(
12249,@ankleorthopod Spend some time on nutrition Twitter 😅... keto and vegan groups have merged into one giant anti mask/anti vax/ anti establishment pseudoscience club
12250,"For any vegans who follow me... vegan ≠ anti vax
vegan ≠ anti statin
abstaining from animal products is not a cure all
statins save lives
vaccines work
❤️"
12251,"@melanielynngrif @drsimonegold Fine, I am not advocating anti mask wearing, anti social distancing and anti Vax. I am not calling you names nor am I calling the virus a hoax. I just am skeptical, questioning authority. Why do I question authority you ask?"
12252,This is DISGUSTING behavior. I don’t care if you’re pro vax or anti vax or. Be an effing decent human being. I’m appalled anyone would think this is appropriate to say to a grieving mother https://t.co/Okd5WOTHaL
12253,I can’t believe how many people are anti vax....i will be taking that shit like it’s a green tea shot https://t.co/snsmeggqf6
