Immune compromised people cannot get a vaccine because it cannot create immunity.

So, If you have a immune system, a vaccine will supercharge it."
9999,@RegionofHalton Sure. The difference is that some are more effective than others. By as much as 30%. This is for the standard virus. Plus the viral vector vaccines from AZ and J&amp;J appear to be less effective against the new strains than the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna
10000,"This is an extremely helpful and reassuring discussion of this article, which suggested that the mRNA vaccines may not be effective for those of us on immunosuppressive drugs.  The key point is that the immune response is fully effective after the second dose. https://t.co/pwm3fRPdLV"

13331,"This vaccine is a great reason to make science more accessible and articles easier to read. Explaining how it works and how it was tested is way more effective than just saying it‚Äôs been tested, trust it."
13332,"The Specialists say that if we continue to wear masks. The worst of this epidemic could be over by Spring assuming we receive the vaccine.   We ,just as I warned years ago,  have to be better prepared to recognize virus dangers earlier and be more effective and diligent early on!"
13333,"@BadCOVID19Takes If these scientists can come up with a 95% effective vaccine without isolating the virus, they are even smarter than I thought"
13334,The only reason we know these vaccines are safe and effective is because selfless people agreed to be injected with something never before tested in humans. To deny those who received a placebo access to what is now known as a highly efficacious vaccine is just cruel. https://t.co/Nwf3KMnrs7
13335,@drdavidsamadi Maybe you should stop praising a 94% effective vaccine for a 99% ineffective virus?üëáüëáüëáüëáüëá https://t.co/9639YXM0yj
13336,"Interesting, sounds like this was earlier in the year.  Projecting 60-70% actually effective vaccine and may need a yearly vaccine due to mutations in the virus... https://t.co/PKh0pY9aC2"
13337,I was tripping about the Covid vaccine being 95% effective only to find the flu vaccines only be 60% at best ..wtf
13338,"To retain its effectiveness, the Phizer vaccine needs to be shipped and delivered at minus 95 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, how will you know that your dose was effective, that it didn't get a little too warm along the way?
You won't."
13339,This is going to turn into a spectacle! Peer pressure to take the vaccine is going to be as effective as asking people to stay home during the holidays. https://t.co/FzygDF9IGs
13340,"Shut up and do what you‚Äôre told!

Masks don‚Äôt work, oh wait now they do

Kids are safe, oh wait never mind, close the schools, oh wait open the schools

Close non essential small businesses, but you can buy picture frames at target

Vaccine is 90% effective,
Oh wait.....ü§î"
13341,"@TWilsonOttawa @CanuckSync Used to take years to develop an effective vaccine for anything.

Then the gov't exempted companies for being sued if someone gets sick / dies from a Covid vaccine and .... Bam ..... Vaccines available in months.

My niece almost died from a known vaccine shot (GBS) ... I'll wait"
13342,"@devchev77 @WBrettWilson I rarely if ever agree with Wilson but I will take the vaccine but only after I watch and learn how the majority of ppl are not only not having bad reactions, but is it effective...then I‚Äôll go ahead."
13343,@kylegriffin1 Crazy people are not going to give two fucks about this. Anti-intellectualism is been part of our DNA for far too long in this nation and thus many many Americans will not CC take the vaccine making it far less effective in America making our battle with Covid much longer.
13344,"@kaitlinmonte The other interesting and possibly scary aspect is the science doesn't know yet if the vaccine will completely suppress the virus.

Yes, the vaccines are 90%+ effective, but it is unknown if a person who is vaccined could still possibly shed the virus - ie contagious to others."
13345,"I think she needs treatment for her anxiety. And I know that, even after there‚Äôs a vaccine, she‚Äôs going to hear that it‚Äôs ‚Äúonly 90% effective‚Äù and her math-deprived brain will hear ‚Äú10% chance of dying of covid‚Äù and she‚Äôll be one of those who refuses to resume normal life."
13346,@jkenney So many Albertans will die before the vaccine is effective in your province. Premier Kenney has failed Alberta
13347,"@MeleahL We will not be changing any of our behavior from 8 days ago until this vaccine is in our bodies and effective. 

I love my wife but that woman has a trash immune system."
13348,"Thank you @GovSisolak for working with state and local officials to design a safe and effective vaccine distribution plan. In the meantime, we must bridge the gap until the vaccine is widely available and continue to follow CDC guidelines. https://t.co/nNWuK7RYtP"
13349,I will say this and I will say this once. If this vaccine mutates and the vaccine is ineffective all this will be for nothing. I am praying it is effective and this virus is killed. But if it doesn‚Äôt? Man a lot of people were freaking anxious lemmings. Including myself
13350,"A great story on the drive and science behind delivering a safe, effective COVID-19 vaccine. Meet Moncef Slaoui. https://t.co/i350Zq0f1j via @usatoday"
13351,"If I‚Äôve learned anything about COVID so far, it‚Äôs that nothing about it is easy. I‚Äôm not expecting that so change with the vaccine. Fully expecting them to be like ‚ÄúYeah, the most effective injection site is your eyeball‚Äù or some shit like that."
13352,"@brian2003999 Really?

It doesn't bother me at all. I know the Moderna vaccine has been tested on 100,00 people. 

It's 95% effective with zero side effects. 

You'll be fine. Vaccines have been around for 250 years. No worries!

13353,"Specifically, Kirchdoerfer‚Äôs research has found its way into both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which in clinical trials have proven to be 95% effective in provoking an immune response to SARS-CoV-2."
13354,"@RobinWordbird @enkamontii @NYGovCuomo Ma‚Äôam, COVID-19 recovery rate is between 97% and 99.75% while the vaccine is said 95% effective. Like I said before, a couple of months ago nobody knew what it was or how it spread. It is impossible that complete research has been done as far as long-term effects."
13355,"@politico IT'S OBVIOUS THAT ""ADVISE"" TO ""GET TESTED"" IS AS REDUNDANT AS ""GOOD WILL""
IN THIS DOG EAT DOG WORLD THAT NORTH AMERICA HAS BECOME!!
WE MUST HAVE ON-THE- SPOT TESTING AT ALL INDOOR GATHERINGS &amp; AT HOME WHICH WOULD BE MORE SUSTAINABLY EFFECTIVE  THAN VACCINES!"
13356,"Many thanks üôè Mr.President @volkan_bozkir @UN_PGA for your strong leadership on countering #infodemia !  ü¶† We have to develop an effective vaccine against #infodemia : support to media, media and information literacy, transparency on media platforms, fact checking. https://t.co/ZEB9PNhsDK"

13358,"A lot, A LOT, of conservatives out there praising the British NHS today for their quick vaccine roll out. Amazing house effective a universal healthcare system can be."
13359,"So the survival rate from Covid 19 is 99.7%

This untried and untested vaccine is only 95% effective 

@MattHancock is endorsing it with reckless haste 

He has no qualifications or experience in the medical field whatsoever https://t.co/7QzdZ7xdfr"
13360,"It takes a minimum of seven years to determine whether a new vaccine is truly effective without dangerous side effects

This has been recklessly rushed through by our Health Secretary who has no qualifications or experience in the medical field whatsoever https://t.co/GKuwTkX4vu"
13361,"Heartening news that pharmaceutical/biotechnology firm like @pfizer &amp; @moderna_tx have developed effective vaccines for COVID-19. Now let‚Äôs expedite the approvals, distributions &amp; inoculations. We can beat this scourge and save lives #vaccine #AstraZeneca #VaccinesWork #Moderna"
13362,"@Konagal7 @RollingLady @thecons31997111 @ChristineNiles1 @kaitlancollins 3. The vaccine was a huge gamble. If it was found not to be effective the money would have been lost. Scientists globally started working on a vaccine in December, 2019. Congress appropriated funding for development in February. Trump simply put a cute name on it in March."
13363,"@tracewtf The vaccine is 95% effective 
NO SIDE EFFECTS 
Get ready to a shot in the arm!!!

NO EXCUSES!!! https://t.co/pgtujkdImf"
13364,"@TheFiveFNC @greggutfeld once again @TheJuanWilliams gets it wrong. Juan says don't give the vaccine to the old first its not effective. REALLY?
https://t.co/6lEYAdtFS0"
13365,@PnPCBC @erinotoole We Canadian want approved safe vaccine. No complete data is available. No 1 knows how long the vaccine is effective for. How long vaccine works for. What gender/age group works best &amp; because conservative opposition have nothing else to do . Best would be to give them vaccine 1st
13366,@thomaskaine5 Do it when it‚Äôs your turn assuming the FDA agrees the vaccine is safe and effective
13367,So the World Health Organization &amp; the CDC expects us to take the COVID-19 vaccine to help end the spread of COVID-19? Why doesn't Trump vaccinate himself and his family first to test how effective this vaccine is and see what side effects this drug has?
13368,"üá®üá¶ has secured up to 429M doses of 7 #COVID19 vaccine candidates, the most extensive &amp; diverse vaccine portfolio of any country.

13373,@RChilderhose @vankayak @cathmckenna @erinotoole No one knows how long Covid vaccine will be effective. No one knows whom the vaccine (elders/child) vaccine will work. Unless we get complete data nothing can be said. No one knows long term side affects of vaccine .
13374,"If we get a safe and effective vaccine, I‚Äôd like to see proof of vaccination tied to receipt of a stimulus check."
