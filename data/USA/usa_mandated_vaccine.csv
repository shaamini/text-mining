Also, mRNA has been around for decades."

The most important thing you can do when it comes to medical decisions is consult a medical doctor that you know and trust.

2669,@newscentermaine I hope that once the vaccines have full FDA approval the country will be mandated as well!! That‚Äôs how we stopped polio!!!
2670,Re vaccination mandate. Trying to understand individual sincere fear and doubt about vaccines. But can‚Äôt understand health care workers and teachers not being mandated if they wish to work. It‚Äôs legal to do so. And protects others. Mandating masks indoors is a must. Period.
2671,@JasonR_Badger @JyotishankarR @Cleavon_MD @The_BMC @POTUS 1. When we wrote this I thought we could complete the trial w patients already admitted to our ICU.

2689,@K_Dub24208 1/2 I hope you didn‚Äôt spend too much time writing one of the most nonsensical tweets I‚Äôve seen this week. You got kids? Did they take their government-mandated vaccines before entering school? If the answers are YES and YES‚Ä¶please tell me about choice.

‚Ä¶ same with the military."
2693,"Seeing some less-educated folks saying we need to go into lockdown until we have herd immunity. Folks, isolation doesn‚Äôt convey immunity, vaccination does. I know this is all I talk about but we really, really need mandated vaccines, we can‚Äôt wait 3-5 years to educate people."
2694,@markghost45 These people are idiots.Theres even precident for mandatory Vax. Boston mandated vaccines for the smallpox  epidemic befor ww1 and no one was put in camps .But they Eliminated smallpox.
2695,"@fromMA @JanetWh73321853 Well there is the second hand smoke thing. Also uses a lot of health resources that ultimately costs us all. I'm not arguing with your premise. It is frustrating and I think vaccines should be mandated in the interest of public health, but no issue is one dimensional."
2696,@shannon_last I worked at Good Sams for 5 years many years ago . It was mandated for employment that we had have a flu shot and TB test every year. I surprised the vaccine is not mandatory there.
2697,@iTweetTurf @PHSisk @penn_state @US_FDA There are mandated ones yes but the Covid ones are under emergency use status.  This could get mandated one day I'm sure. But the latest strains will probably prolong that process.  We will probably start to see how effective these vaccines are in coming weeks
2698,@PHSisk @penn_state @US_FDA You do know there are already mandated vaccines right? This isn‚Äôt a new thing.

2703,Why would OSHA choose now to revoke it's previous guidance regarding employer mandated COVID-19 vaccines? The change means employers can force employees to vaccinate while assuming no responsibility if anything goes wrong. Someone should contest that. https://t.co/jD165YHxZD
2704,"The argument that you have to have small pox and other vaccines for schools etc, is not the same as the COVID vaccine. Nobody ever mandated a flu shot for the general population"
2705,@VABVOX @OutFrontCNN This school mandated masks. But 4 out of 5 teachers infected WERE NOT VACCINATED. Mandate vaccines!
2706,"@ElishaSilanne No, you weren‚Äôt allowed to go to school without them. I understand people may be hesitant but to say that mandated vaccines is not a thing in America is Ahistorical. We have def had mandated vaccines and it makes sense because ppl wont even wear a mask to protect other ppl"

It was our choice
2712,"This is one of the most moronic tweets I have ever read for so many reasons

2719,@EagleCoach09 @mt_stjohn There are people in our society who do not have those vaccines. I think they're nuts but they need to be allowed to make their decisions. Mandated medical decisions lead to nothing good.
2720,"@chrisRMNU @Lugon83 @JoeSkilliams I respect your right not to be vaccinated, it is your choice.  The government hasn't mandated the covid vaccine, they are simply encouraging people to take it which is their job. I would urge folks to do their research and talk to their doctors. Ultimately your choice."

2727,@whatifisaidit Hence the reason children are mandated to get many vaccines to start and then continue with their matriculation thru school. This all has a precedent based on public safety!
2728,The logic Biden pushes on the American people makes no sense. Hurry up to go get your vaccine so you can still spread variants. Oh and put your mask back on. The Flu has a shot every year that‚Äôs not pushed and mandated. Stop putting everyone through a circus and fire Fauci! 99.8

2731,@SrCarlosMachina @ASlavitt That is broad.  Be specific if you are going to ask a ? like that.
