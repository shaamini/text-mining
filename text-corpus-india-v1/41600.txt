Since I was vaccinated with astrazeneca at 9 of the in the morning. After the injection, there we are no symptoms at all, everything was normal, just a little pain in the arm. It is now 4:20 p.m. No symptoms, no fever, no headache, no nausea, just a little pain in the arm. #Wait to see the symptoms tonight #Day 1 #I will come to update the symptoms.
