Review of #astrazeneca vaccination, first injection, injected at 16.46. Started chilling around 3 pm and started to have a high fever of 40 degrees. In the morning, the fever dropped to 39.6. Very suffering. Tired. I want to sleep all day. It is not delicious to eat anything. Now the fever is still at 38.7 loudly_crying_face.
