syringe 1 syringe vaccination review Bang Sue Central Station is booked through a mobile operator. The place is spacious, very airy, well organized. The resulting vaccine was astrazeneca. The first point was lower than normal blood pressure. need to drink more water and walk back and forth to the temple again as usual Fill out the documents for injection. The nurse injected her hand very gently, it did not hurt at all. Sit and wait for normal symptoms. Waiting to see tonight..victory_handlight_skin_tonesmiling_face_with_smiling_eyes
