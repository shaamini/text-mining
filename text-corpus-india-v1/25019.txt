Five generations of the family together. This complete and joint family of ours from grandmother to grandson. Grandmother, mother-father, family of three brothers and one sister, niece-son-in-law, grandson all together. This is the happiest experience of #lockdown. Both 45+ family members and 18+ members have taken the first dose of #covidvaccine.
