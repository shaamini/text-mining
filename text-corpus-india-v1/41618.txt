I was scheduled for the #astrazeneca vaccination on July 1st. This notice has been postponed indefinitely. 'It's not your turn yet' asked the staff member. When the vaccine arrives, you will be notified via the phone number provided. I check both the website and my phone every day. This hour, whatever vaccine arrives, they are happy to inject it. Usually, I am always cautious.
