Symptoms update 24 hours after astrazeneca vaccination we are chills. My body was hot around 5am but I did not know if I had a fever or not. So I woke up to take 2 paracetamol along with wiping my body. In addition, there was pain in the arm at the injection site, but not much pain. Throughout the day, there was aches and pains.
