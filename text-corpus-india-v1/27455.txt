My status is Feb 2021 asking the government to prioritize the provision of vaccines in the Klang Valley first. since last year at the beginning of covid, klang valley is the highest contributor in malaysia. if it used to be for the initial vaccine to klang valley, sure now our case is low & amp; can be cross -state. stupid govt.
