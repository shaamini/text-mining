What is this, how do you do the third dose? The first time in my life I had a fever, then I slept in the afternoon and woke up for dinner while I was sleeping in a closed box. I cannot hear and I cannot open my eyes at all. Even my mother knocks on me. I never hear the mobile ring. Then I woke up and recovered, thank God.
