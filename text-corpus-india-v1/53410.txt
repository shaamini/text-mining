A friend around us is infected. Although we just hit moderna, we don’t dare to take it lightly. Tomorrow, the children will not go to school. We will do a test at home and ask the school’s opinion before going. The epidemic in Thailand is developing, but it may be related to the weather, and the spread is not as fast as the legend, so everyone is not nervous. In China, we have to get on a car and send it to the suburbs for isolation.
