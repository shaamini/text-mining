Talk to a Dutch friend today. She complained that her country injecting covid vaccine is very slow. Just injecting 2 million out of 17 million people. So she said that it is not yet. She still does not know what is really slow. Thailand has injected 3 hundred thousand people from the population of 70 million people. #Covid19 vaccine
