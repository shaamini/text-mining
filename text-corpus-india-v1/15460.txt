Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah Sarve Santu Niramayah. Sarve Bhadrani Pashyantu Ma Kashchit Dukh Bhagbhavet. Brihadaranyaka Upanishad means: May all be happy, May all be free from disease, May all be a witness to the auspicious and let no one be a partaker of sorrow. folded_hands #covidvaccine #covidvaccination
