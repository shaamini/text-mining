Injected moderna 3 needles, after 24 hours it is not that bad. I think that I have prepared quite well, injected at 10.30 on Sunday, very heavy arms. I had a migraine-like headache that came around midnight. But now it is 16.46 on Monday. The fever has arrived. I know that I am hot and have a headache again.
