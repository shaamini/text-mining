There is a huge shortage of vaccine in the whole country, there is no vaccine and now the government has extended the time between the two doses of Kovishield to 12-16 weeks. First 4, then 6-8 weeks and now 12-16 weeks. Why does the central government not accept that the production of the vaccine will have to be done by sharing the license. #covishield
