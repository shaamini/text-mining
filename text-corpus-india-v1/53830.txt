Review of moderna vaccination that was reserved in the past with a small hospital in short : bad management bad appointment firmware system very difficult to contact Do not measure temperature, pressure, or anything before injecting. If you are going to inject it, let us inject it at a large hospital. Now, I start to have a little pain in my arm, no fever yet. End of the review.
