Singapore got the vaccine at the end of last year and it took 6 months to manage the injection for the general public as well. Now I will inject pfizer and moderna. The sinovac has just been delivered during Feb. and Singapore approval. Just 2 things before sinovac, we have not seen the state to inject.
