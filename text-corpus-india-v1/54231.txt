Ah forget everyone in Vietnam but get two injections, hopefully everyone will be able to cross-inject the two vaccines. At the time when I got injections on radio, there was only az, now in Vietnam, az and pfizer and moderna in general are much better compared to 4 months ago when I received the first injection.
