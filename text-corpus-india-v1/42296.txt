Vaccinated. Got astrazeneca sbs. Management is pretty good. After injection, wait for half an hour to see symptoms. Get an appointment, get 1 popsicle stick I now feel a slight headache. And if you raise your arms, it is a little tight. Then I am not sure if it is a fever or hot air conditioner. Haha. Got the next appointment for 16wk. I secretly asked the officer from the hospital why it took until 16. The officer replied that it depends on the lot face_with_tears_of_joy.
