Last night, I posted about few people registering for vaccination. I want a lot of people to register. Tell them to wait for #pfizer and #moderna before going through FDA 2 Thai first. #Waiting for something that has not arrived. Now we have #aztrazeneca that is ready to be injected at the beginning of next month. I had my mother register and inject it on the 7th day so that she would have immediate immunity.
