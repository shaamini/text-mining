Experience in vaccination with astrazeneca When the doctor gave the injection, there was no feeling that the doctor had injected it, and he still wondered if it had been injected. After the injection is over, take the paracetamol immediately. 16 hours without symptoms is enough only 23.30 astrazeneca is active. From 11:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., the fever goes up and down, wipes and takes paraphernalia every 4 hours. Symptoms have improved.
