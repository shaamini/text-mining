"That's right, if it is been 33 weeks, you cannot take the booster" is the recommendation when taking 2 doses of vaccine because at that time I was afraid I would not have time for the second dose, the baby was delivered but because the booster is one shot, you can take it anytime as long as the contents are 14 weeks onwards.
