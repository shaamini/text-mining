if you do not want to bring out your kids yet, it is your choice. if other fully vaccinated parents who want to bring their children out of the outside world for a while, be the parents who are responsible for keeping the children safe. always put mask, wash tgn, sanitize hands, avoid crowded places, keep distance, etc.
