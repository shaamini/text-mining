My university says that people who have complete injections will gradually come in November, but still have to wait for the announcement from the province. Nov. 25%, Dec. 25%, Jan. 50%. Well, I am just waiting to inject just the modena. Moved there, I had to agree to go for the first sinovac injection in order to inject the second injection into a moderna and go to the hospital. #Where is Moderna?
