After the first day of vaccination, wait for 30 minutes to see the symptoms. There was a dizzying sensation for a moment and then recovered. Back home, I feel pain at the injection site but no fever. On the 2nd day, I feel pain at the injection site, fatigue, chills but no fever. Little headache. Take painkillers to reduce fever and continue sleeping. As for other days, wait to see the next symptom #vaccination #astrazeneca #covid19 vaccine
