The first dose of astrazeneca, no symptoms at all. At first injection, arm pain. Now I have seen symptoms for 2 hours. I have symptoms of thirst all the time. The doctor said that tomorrow I may have a fever. Take 1 and a half tablets of paracetamol every 4 hours. Do not resist. Eat normally. folded_handssmiling_face_with_heart-eyes
