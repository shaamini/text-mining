sotTongue_sticking_out_cheeky_playful_or_blowing_a_raspberry 08/02/22 Morning shave. sputnik is just right for gc_0.84oc. After all, the dew-based replacement blade suits me. If by any chance the war starts, I do not want to buy a spare blade or razor from the dew. Soap has a nice scent of colonia, but citrus has a scent that is disappointing. #shaveoftheday #wetshaving #double-edged razor
