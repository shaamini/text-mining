If I am allergic to vancomycin, can it be injected, I have a kidney transplant. I had just received a prescription from my doctor from dialysis three days ago. The doctor said it was possible to inject after June. Is it a good idea to inject it? smiling_face_with_tearsmiling_face_with_tearsmiling_face_with_tear #astrazeneca
