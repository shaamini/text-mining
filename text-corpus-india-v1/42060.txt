Thank you for not postponing the #astrazeneca vaccination. Went to inject it on Tuesday. The doctor was very polite and gentle. It took less than 10 injections + filling information. Normal lunch minutes are good. Fever at 5 am Have a full rest for 1 day, take medicine, put on a gel sheet to reduce fever. Drink lots of water and eat on time. Thursday was completely gone. victory_handlight_skin_tonesyringe
