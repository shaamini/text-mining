Review of first dose of astrazeneca vaccination syringe 1 week later there is a slight numbness in the tip of the right fingertip. When I first woke up, I slowly sat up. Now I can jump up and stand. From what I have done a few times, I go to the bathroom to pee. Now I cannot get up and do it in the morning. I want to try the second needle pfizer/moderna
