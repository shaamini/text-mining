so pro vaccine: you have to register, you have to fight, you have to wait patiently for the website to load, you have to leave, you have to travel, etc. After that, it is bad because the website cannot be used. how do you want to be vaccinated if you have to register as an anti -vaccine: hang out at home while beating eggs. rileksss.
