same time to go mp last week. he just looked at the profile but the shopÂ² in the mp he checked. if it is a regular restaurant, we can take-away, but we want to go to kaison, we have to be fully vaccinated for 14 days, btw, go to the mp, so we can hold on to defecate at noon, wait for my brother near the cimb.
