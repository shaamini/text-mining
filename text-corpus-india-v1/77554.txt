I am vaccinated check_mark person_running Saturday morning we come to the City Run. After receiving 2 injections of COVID-19 vaccination, the stethoscope syringe asked to run the syringe root as a souvenir, with a distance of 7.34 km, led by Nong Win Anawin, and designed this beautiful root path. Really fun. Thank you very much. grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes
