Yes, we just gave up the sick to not the sick behind the story, as long as the vaccine first. My sister just had to be called for a booster 3 weeks ago, she has already sick so I do not want to be vaccinated anymore, I have to be content because the vaccine status has not been fully vaccinated lately.
