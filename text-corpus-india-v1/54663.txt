When I just watched #Noh Krasae, the president of the Private Hospital Association said that the private sector has come to open for signing up for reservations like this is wrong. I do not have a vaccine yet. How can I open a reservation? Moderna has not even set a date to come in yet. Why did you talk about it? Why is it still available for booking?
