Yesterday I went for the first injection of #astrazeneca. I knew I had to inject it for just one day. Because the office informed me on Saturday and had to inject on Monday, Sunday evening. I felt that migraines had come to a lot of headaches, but I felt like I had to take a migraine medication and endured it until I had to inject it. Eat until you are full. They say you need to drink a lot of water and continue to eat.
