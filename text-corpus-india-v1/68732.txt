I brought a Japanese vaccine passport to Dr. Sato and came to collect blood to see if the antibody for the new roller was properly produced by inoculation. After 2 weeks of hitting twice, there is a 95% chance that you will have antibodies. Once the doctor confirms them, they will be vaccinated in the behavior management app. (Although it is already in my app.)
