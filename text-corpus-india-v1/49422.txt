#covishield The first dose of covishield was written on the certificate - next due date after 28 days. That is, after 4 weeks. Now it has been reduced to 6 weeks, then 8 weeks, then 12 to 16 weeks. If the shortage of vaccine continues, then you will hear - "One dose is enough. Second dose is not needed."
