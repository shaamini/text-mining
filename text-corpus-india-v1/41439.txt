The doctor said that the best way is to wait for the second astrazeneca first, wait 6 months, then move to moderna 2 needles, it is like a different injection. that is not a booter But the doctor was not sure if it was dangerous or not. Because I have not met anyone who has done it, but the group of doctors wants to do it because Dr. Chinovak has already taken 2 injections.
