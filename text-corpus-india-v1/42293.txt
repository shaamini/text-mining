Just in case astrazeneca is given to my mother too. Do not run out of it yet. You can see a lot of astra today. PS. Mother is an elderly person, aged 74, who registered with the doctor and was ready to queue at the beginning of next month. Mother took the antidepressant sertraline and consulted her doctor. The doctor recommends astra injection.
