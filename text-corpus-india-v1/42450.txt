The company that we are riding in a deli has sms to register for free astrazeneca injections with 10 other close people, go down and then just wait for sms to make an appointment for the day. for a long time But the other day, someone yelled at the fan page that they had received sms. When they arrived, why did they inject sinovac? Why is it not like what they said?
