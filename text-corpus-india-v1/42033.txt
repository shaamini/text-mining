oxford astrazeneca. The first 2 hours can still hang out. After 8 hours of waking up, I had a fever and my hands felt like they we are being beaten by people in the village. the body is not very comfortable. After that I went to the doctor because my blood pressure dropped and I had to be injected and take medicine. after that it is just good. smiling_face_with_tear
